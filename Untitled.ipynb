hour overlong there ` s rather unrealistic bit like warder someone kill find Dufresne probably innocent Oh many prison friendship black man white man Maybe last point shouldn ` t take criticism performance Morgan Freeman Tim Robbins good make movie Neither give flashy performance Again criticism subtle role imagine different movie would we ` d Tom Cruise Denzil Washington star Perhaps Freeman ` s character Red seem write white character he ` s good role Am I alone think Freeman best black actor Hollywood last decade he ` s interested explore character instead play someone who ` s black There ` s also outstanding touch director Frank Darabont Witness scene early film Andy spend first night prison darkness fall upon prisoner face It ` s almost like artwork Andy Dogg prisoner

9 Avengers Infinity War best movie since LOTR I almost wordless LOTR 1 movie time Avengers Infinity War another LOTR still I love LOTR good LOTR fill great motivational message difference put aside IW = LOTR maybe even better LOTR Hat Marvel Avengers Infinity War THE BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER Engrossing Epic Emotional Those three E define movie The late instalment Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise best culminate ten year marvel adventure spectacle big bold movie superhero genre \\nSo let start Anthony Joe Russo genius make beast movie After announce direct next two Avengers movie Marvel fan know dark Avengers movie yet Yes dark serious tone More Winter Soldier Civil War previous marvel movie direct Russo Bothers combine also Avengers movie well humour tasteless Nobody really care necessary humour work along edgy part movie This far Russo brother best work among Marvel movie completely raise bar superhero movie high Praise Christopher Markus Stephen McFeely write amazing script also write script Captain America The Avengers Winter Soldier Age Ultron Civil War also know best marvel movie \\nNow character story Practically everyone see previous marvel movie dead movie Everyone chance shine even small way possible There many character arcs movie none cut short boring Every scene movie worth digest decipher along surprise twist turn get audience edge seat Everything character development pace storyline make jump scream gasp cry \\nAnd course one Thanos The villain tease one many time finally delivers Josh Brolin officially portray best villain MCU completely piss Marvel villain problem He bring table everything get Not hate Thanos end movie understand maybe even feel sorry second They bring layer one see movie portrayal Marvel villain They make scary strong time vulnerable understandable The motivation character development make best character movie make movie \\nI can not tell anymore movie I would spoil All I say whether marvel fan least know go previous marvel movie GO AND WATCH IT It waste time money Digest prepare come I may bias I I rate movie 10 10 If I I would betray Overrated bloat This movie underwhelming chaotic blend several different movie I go break several different element movie either work really work I start villain Thanos whole pretty good villain He intimidate movie give good script The problem power freakin inconsistent Guardians Galaxy already establish powerful infinity stone Infinity War seem forget In battle Titan Iron Man five others able hold Thanos nearly get gauntlet At point Thanos four infinity stone Sorry way could restrain point Infinity War also include four villain director apparently felt need introduction Collectively call Black Order dark order name never say I give nicknames There Noseless Terrible terrible Avatar Lady Horns also terrible Rock Dude basically Korg big goatee Guy Pointy Axe The people understand heck character Marvel comic fan The big problem Infinity War character development inconsistency I describe bad case Star Lord When first Guardians Galaxy come Star Lord great character Infinity War completely ruin He turn jealous jerk actual idiot There brief flash old Star Lord mostly character despise At one point battle Titan Thanos home planet Iron Man Doctor Strange Guardians Galaxy Thanos hold nearly remove gauntlet make sense first place point Thanos four feakin infinity stone As remove glove Thanos hand Star Lord find Thanos kill Gamora earlier movie \\nStar Lord start punch wake Mantis mind power time demolish go destroy half galaxy Vision The development Vision also really really bad In Age Ultron strong enough wield Thor hammer Infinity War develop update point never win single fight anyone fit plot Thor So Thor Ragnarok establish Thor god thunder need hammer powerful Then Infinity War completely forget make get toss around like ragdoll In fact never even use lightning ability forge new weapon Did director forget get establish Ragnarok make Thor weak fit plot Marvel get away whatever heck want Scarlet Witch Wow Her character inconsistent One minute get demolish dark order member next hold Thanos five infinity stone point extend period time Once power powerful director need give scene Hulk So apparently Hulk scar come Ahh poor little guy This terrible plot twist really make much sense Another thing work movie sheer amount character I worry might many As result many different subplots go even one final battle They two climactic battle go one time result bloat mass CGI fill action last forty five minute movie Now I discuss action movie rating major battle brief description New York battle 2 10 This battle absolutely terrible Noseless Terrible come Rock Dude tear city take Doctor Strange away nothing action even slightly thrill The action Alicia Vikander Tomb Raider good action battle Wakanda battle 8 10 This battle actually pretty thrill great background music really cool action The first half battle lot better second though It also get annoy feed short segment flash back battle Titan Thor forge hammer axe thingy Overall though battle good part reason I give Infinity War 6 something much low Battle Titan 6 10 While good action battle also ton inconsistency revolve around Thanos powerful Overall I super impressed I also need discus Thanos plan second He want wipe half universe population universe overcrowd Then finally rest Did think fact universe repopulate hard work nothing I definitely prefer storyline involves threat total destruction earth Finally I go discuss character kill movie make Avengers 4 really predictable So end movie Thanos snap finger infinity stone half universe kill Somehow random selection original avenger survive The odds happen 1 64 assume Hawkeye survive dreaded finger snap Thanos 1 32 die epic game session friend guess get bored whole avenger thing The character die almost new character like Black Panther Spiderman Doctor Strange etc Several character already plan sequel know go come back original Avengers find way time travel reverse everything It predictable Overall Infinity War good movie I understand hype It choppy inconsistent overcrowd overall great movie crack I would recommend go theater one I leave feel exhaust tired MCU Everything could\\ hop Oh My God What incredible film I\\ never do review movie I\\ do

infinity stone click finger half humanity include half avenger important note original avenger still alive dissolve dust give impression death I expect character come back point next Avengers film likely due original save My final theory regard Doctor Strange On ship Stark Spidey Strange say come would save stone Stark Spidey\\ live However end see Strange give stone Thanos condition Stark stay alive My prediction Strange saw possible future future win must heavily rely Tony Stark Which make sense Tony start finish Incredible film can\\ wait next one see resolve 9 8 10 An objective review

villain ever first time action finally 3 easily fun emotional Experience I marvel movie since first Avengers movie A solid 10 10 hopefully people Avengers Infinity War Marvels crown jewel Let clear Infinity War flawless fault thankfully overshadow two hour awesomeness Every movie Marvel universe last decade ultimately build therefore expectation roof part delivers Almost every character MCU team face dangerous foe yet mad titan Thanos know anything comic go know brace heartache With hype survive film I leave wonder many death permanent superhero universe never say never Though story Thanos motivation differ comic forgiven new story wafer thin competent As imagine one exciting thing Infinity War unite hero never see side side certainly deliver front The action thick fast despite dark overtone plenty comedy teenage Groot ruin film like I fear would Obviously big finale merely high profile chapter much large story movie highly climatic regardless I sadden two parter alike Civil War 2016 huge story perhaps break across movie Infinity War contender best Marvel movie instead feel burnt never end stream film wet appetite I wait next film Excellent stuff though blue hell Ant Man The Good Children ThanosThanosAll action expectedTies everything together nicelyThe Bad Peter Dinklage Never think I say So many character spread thinThings I Learnt From This Movie If Thanos Cable ever meet go super weirdDishonest footage photo commonplace Look footage Hulk Wakanda run rest team Seriously never happen Somewhere right DC fan claim bad film Do believe rating movie nearly good people claim In end movie prove absolute slugfest never stop The action nonstop neither buildup climax action This could redeem actor time job never give time perform character rather disconnect surroundings reaction ridiculous The character give time evolve movie Thanos interesting figure I fully approve chose adapt motivation instead follow comic book But one character enough usual nothing line hardly surprising since need milk every cent franchise I way blame But movie end single character kill except heimdal I really bother cash grab way longer For people actually believe half character die pity stupidity painfully obvious revive next movie everything continue \\n \\nThe day marvel decide actually heroes sacrifice crap take responsibility action day I respect marvel After watch movie I feel correct way continue make entire movie complete utter failure Peter Quill like Danny Rand defender Who rate 9 This awful movie pretentious try hard plot story developement mediocre act performance One lead actress use work website videforex tk model account manager end A list movie The first avenger quite original But one I excpecting way better I spend time think cold theater interested thing blow movie LOL Seems Hollywood CGI puppet make superheros movie make first place If keep make movie like one people start watch 50 title Just cent Didn live hype This movie Is hype The title movie Infinity

whatsoever At least I child film use make bit sense milennials seem New world new style little brain Pity Lots die character plot hole CGI make good movie SPOILER So far I enjoy MCU I understand 31 movie lead Nevertheless I leave disgruntled end didn\\ waste time wait post credit scene There much senseless fight little story Too many idiotic plot hole Too many character kill sake Thor get ass whipped start movie nearly kill Thanos stone At end popular character like Black Panther Doctor Strange Spiderman turn ash really KNOW go permanent So first place Why show half universe actually balance actually mean reaction universe Avengers little scale many brilliant mind row unprepared Civil War Avengers Infinity War dishonest idiotic simply awful almost every aspect handle While hero across Marvel cinematic universe unite joint effort stop Thanos problem think unite joint effort bring Infinity War It note I big fan Marvel Cinematic Universe For part I find movie passable I really like Black Panther Captain America The Winter Soldier I despise Iron Man 2 The Avengers Infinity War could fall anywhere spectrum unfortunately fell way low side second bad movie entire franchise The opening scene movie perfect setup wrong Avengers Infinity War Thanos Josh Brolin attack Asgardian ship main character Thor Ragnarok Thanos kill everyone aboard except character necessary help keep plot move Heimdall Idris Elba leave wound kill Thanos screen use power send Hulk Bruce Banner Earth effort warn Avengers It suppose emotional death scene laziness write showcasing character stupidity purpose plot progression evident Why didn\\ Thanos kill Heimdall attack ship like everyone else board It\\ simple plot would able continue do Character stupidity time high Avengers Infinity War restrict Thanos There lack communication character reason movie happen Star Lord Chris Pratt go far screw everything easily worst write scene entire movie The stupidity character attribute awfully write script So much dialogue movie Marvel quip lot come form character throw personal jab one another point wonder hero can\\ set aside difference annoy even five minute order stop villain want wipe half universe\\ population Yep that\\ right Thanos\\ goal wipe half population entire universe One complaint people Marvel safe character feel So Thanos kill half population would seem like put character danger right Wrong All character kill Thanos character already overstay welcome franchise feel permanent let\\ honest need future installment Marvel universe It ironic movie seemingly take risk movie play thing safest Even death feel like risk would really matter With many character focus movie almost time character arcs fine instead must show character speech action However many character act annoy stupid wish kill character kill end Thanos destroy half population lack emotional weight nearly three hour unbearable character dialogue relief movie almost The two thing Infinity War well make story feel jumbled clustered character good job character Scarlet Witch Elizabeth Olson Vision Paul Bettany When come everything else movie fall prey term film critic Roger Ebert use \\ idiot plot \\ Idiot plot mean way plot happen character act like idiot I already go little bit explain even smart character act like moron movie plot progress entire plot movie idiot plot well Thanos\\ plan wipe half population make sense point backstory In execution plan fall apart become dumb think This might though movie try paint Thanos plan depth sort plan would make sense work generic super hero villain want destroy world evil So villain faux depth evil plan would work generic super villain character overall plot movie dumb villain scheme awful juxtaposition Infinity War put simply awful Nothing nothing less And movie big decade hype buildup plan sad I expect Not everything glitter gold I\\ say often script writer past year successful SciFi franchise I mean every story end

challenge Anything dangerous come could simply step another part universe could use Reality Stone turn everything soap bubble We use power scarcely Well otherwise movie would 10 minute All fight leave wonder Thanos use power Not convinving When team Titan Thanos sleep don\\ even try kill seem would reasonable thing And Peter Quill short victory remove gauntlet can not stop talk slap bare hand Seriously Lame stupid Wakanda nation advance technology line foot soldier one one combat killer beasts 18th century battle tactic 21st century Seriously Instead use advanced technology shield even

really unprofessional How Thanos know go vanish along half universe Was simply lucky Amount superheroes stagger Nobody pay watch favourite chracters little interaction whatsoever The movie bring us nothing new It felt like well prepared mixture previous Marvel movie This we\\ wait Utterly dissatisfy Infinity War Provides Infinite Disappointment After ten year epic wait get chance clarify The Russo Brothers awful choice Marvel Cinametic Universe Infinity War include 30 main character start quick plot without lose time introduce heroes The movie go funny bit pop nowhere non stop action

review movie time ultimate disappointment Clap Trap Movie hell belive hype around film So lame plotless Made child moron world Glad every tool universe saw Hard review cause story Very poorly handle If love mcu film probably love one If avid film enthusiast like probably similar complaint im go say \\nFor one film try focus thing actually capable pull There many character film character like black widow black panther reduce second screen time Characters actually somewhat integral plot one dimensional might well get second screen time \\nOn top character usually bring forth ton charm regardless movie quality like thor star lord completely unlikable movie Actors like Robert Downey Jr completely phone performance make dull atmosphere even compare sub par mcu film \\nThe direction movie TERRIBLE It poorly handle For example Gamorrah death scene shoot like low budget sappy music video The shot distract I actually laugh attempted dramatic moment film \\nOverall film good cinema
