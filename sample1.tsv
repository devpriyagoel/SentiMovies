I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn\'t intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don\'t normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it\'s technical merits - I don\'t really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.', 'A classic piece of unforgettable film-making. In its Oscar year, Shawshank Redemption (written and directed by Frank Darabont, after the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King) was nominated for seven Academy Awards, and walked away with zero. Best Picture went to Forrest Gump, while Shawshank and Pulp Fiction were ""just happy to be nominated."" Of course hindsight is 20/20, but while history looks back on Gump as a good film, Pulp and Redemption are remembered as some of the all-time best. Pulp, however, was a success from the word ""go,"" making a huge splash at Cannes and making its writer-director an American master after only two films. For Andy Dufresne and Co., success didn\'t come easy. Fortunately, failure wasn\'t a life sentence.After opening on 33 screens with take of $727,327, the $25M film fell fast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3M. The reasons for failure are many. Firstly, the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans today, in 1994, people knew not and cared not what a \'Shawshank\' was. On the DVD, Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on ""that \'Rickshaw\' movie."" Marketing-wise, the film\'s a nightmare, as \'prison drama\' is a tough sell to women, and the story of love between two best friends doesn\'t spell winner to men. Worst of all, the movie is slow as molasses. As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post, ""it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance of narrative exit points before settling on its finale."" But it is these same weaknesses that make the film so strong.Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. It\'s in music, it\'s in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo; ""In here\'s where you need it most,"" he says. ""You need it so you don\'t forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren\'t made out of stone. That there\'s a - there\'s a - there\'s something inside that\'s yours, that they can\'t touch."" Red (Morgan Freeman) doesn\'t think much of Andy at first, picking ""that tall glass o\' milk with the silver spoon up his ass"" as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word, and losing his bet, Red resents him for it. But over time, as the two get to know each other, they quickly become the best of friends. This again, is one of the film\'s major strengths. Many movies are about love, many flicks have a side-kick to the hero, but Shawshank is the only one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two best friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship time and again, when it\'s a feeling that weighs so much into everyone\'s day to day lives. Perhaps it\'s too sentimental to seem conventional, but Shawshank\'s core friendship hits all the right notes, and the film is much better for it.It\'s pacing is deliberate as well. As we spend the film watching the same actors, it is easy to forget that the movie\'s timeline spans well over 20 years. Such a huge measure of time would pass slowly in reality, and would only be amplified in prison. And it\'s not as if the film lacks interest in these moments. It still knows where it\'s going, it merely intends on taking its sweet time getting there. It pays off as well, as the tedium of prison life makes the climax that much more exhilarating. For anyone who sees it, it is a moment never to be forgotten.With themes of faith and hope, there is a definite religious subtext to be found here. Quiet, selfless and carefree, Andy is an obvious Christ figure. Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) is obviously modeled on Richard Nixon, who, in his day, was as close to a personified Satan as they come. But if you aren\'t looking for subtexts, the movie speaks to anyone in search of hope. It is a compelling drama, and a very moving film, perfectly written, acted and shot. They just don\'t come much better than this.OVERALL SCORE: 9.8/10 = A+ The Shawshank Redemption served as a message of hope to Hollywood as well. More than any film in memory, it proved there is life after box office. Besting Forrest and Fiction, it ran solely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of 1995. It currently sits at #2 in the IMDb\'s Top 250 Films, occasionally swapping spots with The Godfather as the top ranked film of all time -- redemption indeed. If you haven\'t seen it yet, what the hell are you waiting for? As Andy says, ""It comes down a simple choice, really. Either get busy living, or get busy dying.""', 'This is How Movies Should Be Made This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red\'s group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been ""institutionalized"". The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance. Whatever you do, don\'t listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want.', ""Shawshank Redeems Hollywood Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art?  To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process.  Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus.  Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption.  Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood.  The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover.  After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole.  He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him.  His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding.  Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison.  Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him.  Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success.  Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.  In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature.  Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does.  He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman.  Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue.  Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition.  His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995.  While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with.  The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film.  While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles.  Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen.  Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead.  Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom.  These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story.  Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date.  Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience.  Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think.  He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability.  Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you.  The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film.  It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget."", 'Don\'t Rent Shawshank. I\'m trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You\'ll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it\'s entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you\'ll discover in ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" when you watch it, you\'ll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you\'ll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can\'t find in movies today. Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar. How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn\'t get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like ""It\'s a Wonderful Life"" and ""Citizen Kane."" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time. Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film\'s title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame. But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title.', 'Some birds aren\'t meant to be caged. The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate, Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn\'t give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away.It\'s possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. But when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that\'s dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it\'s the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.Those in support aren\'t faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the ""Birdman Of Shawshank,"" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there\'s Roger Deakins\' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman\'s score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy\'s state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.If you love Shawshank then it\'s a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie, but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10', ""Stephen King's best adapted movie Misery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now you can add Shawshank to that list.This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully. What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come."", 'The Shawshank Redemption One of the finest films made in recent years. It\'s a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That\'s what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It\'s also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King\'s story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people ""will"" be talking about in 50 or 100 years.', 'Simply known as ""The Movie"" Whenever I talk about this movie with my friends, I do not even refer to it by title, but rather as ""The Movie"".  When I say ""The Movie"", my friends know exactly what I\'m talking about.  In fact the main reason that me and my friends don\'t refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it\'s name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption.  Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those ""Budget Theaters"" over the summer of 1995.  None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good.  So, not having any real expectations, we saw it.  When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said ""That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!"" There\'s really no other way I can put it in words.  Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... ""HOPE"".  This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time.  I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history!  How it all just ""comes together"" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a ""must buy"" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see.  I\'ve seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films.  However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, ""That was a great movie, but it wasn\'t nearly as good as \'you know what\'!""  There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my ""favorite of all time"", but they\'ve all fallen far short of ""The Shawshank Redemption"". So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately.  You\'re guaranteed to find it in the ""employee picks"" section. And if it isn\'t in that section, then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them.  If you have seen this movie, go see it again.  If you haven\'t bought your own copy yet, buy one. In fact buy two, and put one in a fire-proof safe, just in case of an emergency. :o) So, you want a 1-10 rating???  I give it a 13!!!!!!', ""Eternal Hope I've lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie, but it is more than 20. It has to be one of the best movies ever made. It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors before.I have from a very young age been a huge fan of anything Stephen King writes and had already read the short story that this movie is based on years prior to seeing this movie.Not everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well, but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movie.Something that is outstanding is the fact that it has no real action, no special effects and no gimmicks. 99% of the movie is just men in a prison uniforms talking. Yet it absolutely hooks you almost from the beginning and has you glued to the screen to the end.For me what really makes this film one of the best is the message of eternal hope it conveys throughout. The never ever give up hope attitude of the main character so well conveyed by Tim Robbins. The ending is just spine tingling every time I see it, no matter how many times I have seen it.Brilliant, brilliant movie and a must see for everyone."", 'its an excellent piece of art i watch this movie for minimum 5-6 times first to last. so every time i enjoyed as i watching it first time. its a piece of art. and we now know how to entertain with no action or fighting scenes. its a pure drama that anyone can enjoy with family in silence. so i rate this movie 10 out of 10 because of amazing screen play, acting, casting, background scoring editing etc. this is my first movie review so pardon me if i did any mistake.', 'Simply amazing. The best film of the 90\'s. The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it\'s almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy\'s relationship with ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy\'s who suffers under the iron will of Norton.If you haven\'t seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be disappointed. It is positively the best movie of the \'90\'s, and one of my Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and heart. 10/10', 'The absolute GREATEST movie of all time. My life is forever changed due to this movie.  It is a movie of hope, ""redemption"", and friendship.  It shows a deep growing friendship between two prisoners, Andy and Red.  They each are shown growing through their distinct hardships at Shawshank prison.  As time passes, hope wanes but a flame burns bright in Andy.  His hope and unrelentless nature carry over to his friend Red.As Red\'s long stay in prison comes to an end he sees the light at the end of the tunnel.  Andy has left it for him to see the way to freedom, and he follows it.This film parallels my life and leaves me wondering if my advice will help somebody see the light.  For some of those people time will tell.  As for now I\'ll be patient to wait and see.  Don\'t end up like Brooks, there will always be someone to help you out.  There is someone out there that cares for you.  Thank you Andy Dufresne, your hope is the flame of my life.', 'I make the questions here! It has a formula that gives you this kick; Darn what a good movie! But I need to say this, sometimes it happens.. So WHY do people love this movie and rate it high, when, or WHY isn\'t the ""smart"" people declare it like a a peace of art? Or do they?! Still I think it\'s darn good...but I bet the producer(s) didn\'t expect that!Like when we vote, for anything, we need to follow our heart. This is a typical movie that is worth every penny, every letter... and it\'s a typical 90\' movie! Oh.. there we have it! Between gone with the wind and now, we NEED this! Love me as I am.. says the storyline, in my head anyway. And I do, yes I do!', ""Oh my godmother Three words: Oh. My. God.How am i supposed to describe this absolutely fantastic and unbelievable film in words? I don't know. But I'll give it a shot. Here goes.This movie is just bloody excellent, brilliant, fantastic, unbelievable, not a thing wrong with it, shocking (in a good way), heck, pretty much every single good comment word you can think of.I mean, for gods sake, its so damn good it takes your breath away! i seriously could not speak after it! it instantly took every other film i had seen under its shadow, and that's saying something, as i have seen some pretty excellent films.There's not a single actor or actress in this movie who is crap!!! standouts are Morgan freeman, Tim Robbins, and the dude who plays brooks.I could say 1239643609260246704272628xinfinity more things good about this movie, but unfortunately I haven't got that much space, and my fingers would get sore.An absolute must see for everyone, and I'm positive that ill never see another movie better than this, and this will stay at #1 on my list forever."", 'The best story ever told on film I believe that this film is the best story ever told on film, and I\'m about to tell you why.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a city banker, wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947 and receives a double life sentence for the crime. Andy forms an unlikely friendship with ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), the man who knows how to get things. Andy faces many trials in prison, but forms an alliance with the wardens because he is able to use his banking experience to help the corrupt officials amass personal fortunes. The story unfolds....I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn\'t even slightly pretentious or cliched, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.But the one thing which makes THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION stand above all other films, is the attention given to the story. The film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It\'s a powerful, poignant, thought-provoking, challenging film like no other. If Andy were to comment on this film, I think he might say: ""Get busy watching, or get busy dying."" Take his advice.Thoroughly recommended.', 'This is a wonderful movie!!!! When I first see it, I am too young to understand all the things the movie what to show us. The film gave me a very different feeling. Hope is a dangerous thing, is the root of mental distress. Because since come in the day, the warden said, ""the soul to god, the body to me.""Except that he can get the cigarettes and naked woman printed CARDS and any other changes I can\'t seem to grow within the walls of the dark. However Andy told him, ""remember, hope is a good thing - and perhaps even good. And no good thing will never disappear."" So Andy can use 20 years digging Red think can chisel in tunnel in six hundred.When he finally climbed out of the five hundred yards of the stench of sewage pipes, standing in the pouring rain can\'t help, we seem to see faith Pierce heavy darkness, played a luminous in the dark of the night out of the blue.Under the light, the soul of our weak under Andy with open arms in the sky in succession, and shaking.', ""Greatest movie of all time! This movie is one of my all time favorites. Undoubtedly, one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Story, cast, screenplay all are great. The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. The amazing casting of both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is amazing, and couldn't be more accurate. It was narrated by Morgan Freeman, who is the best narrator in Hollywood, I believe. Actually the film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It will change the way u think about things around u. Surely, It will teach you one thing that it is easy to take away a man's bread, even his freedom, but impossible to take away his hope.I can say with confidence this is the best movie I have ever seen - or ever will see. If you haven't watch it yet, just GO! Watch it! Now!"", 'Prison thriller with violence, hatred, corruption, friendship and joy. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a timeless story of heartbreak, deception and ultimate growth under the most deplorable conditions. The acting is superior, some of Tim Robbins\' and Morgan Freeman\'s best work as they allow me an intimate look inside the sometimes contradictory nature of a convict\'s existence, where I am torn emotionally between danger and safety, light and shadow, sanity and sorrow, truth and lies, injustice and justice. In fact, I am lost in all the actors\' poignant and memorable portrayals of young thugs, cruel guards, swindlers, thieves, rapists and murders, all standing in their respective spaces quietly listening together to an operatic aria over a loudspeaker on the prison yard.In this movie, I find almost no one to be all good or all bad. There are exceptions, though. Although there are those in charge of the prison I wish to be caught in a snare of their own making or worse, there are still others behind prison walls that turn out to be heroes I cheer on to win in the end. Like people in real life, most of the characters in ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" both prisoners and guards (those that are not miserably rotten to the bone), represent many shades of gray.One of the most touching moments in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a scene in which an elderly convict, who has spent the better part of his adult life locked up, is brokenheartedly paroled into a modern world that is as alien to him as his outdated suit and boyhood memories. And his fear of this new and unnatural terrain, crawling with shadier creatures than those he had known behind bars and the exhaust fumes of a thousand horseless carriages rushing past, engulfed him with no hope of ever escaping.""Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free,"" from ""The Shawshank Redemption.""As bonds form between people of different ethnic groups, economic backgrounds and intellectual levels, I rejoice in their discovery of the human dignity they share. As the story unfolds, my heart hurts so hard, I cry. Then, with tears still in my eyes, I laugh, the same way my family used to laugh together at dinner or a movie when I was a little girl.Getting older. Times changing. People leaving. Dying. But at the core of the main character\'s spirit there shines upon all those who are within its range, including me, a contagious hope eternal. I am still astonished with the euphoria that fills my being each time I view this incredible story about the invincible human spirit.', ""From my favorite movies.. It is one of the best movies in the world that many people will join me. Watching very, very impressed. What it might be called the great stories of Stephen King anyway. Acting on cues can say is enormous. There's no posturing. Especially when Andy Dufrense incredible music that review still stands wandering on everyone's lips. Finale as you lose yourself in it is a movie you are getting into. Finals if he so exhilarating you a high-quality music. And finding that deserves really deserve. I watched this film very young age and it has taught me that the magic of cinema in a nice way. This film is one of the reasons I hate the Oscars. Will remain as the best film in more than 10 years, I believe wholeheartedly sites. Definitely one of the best films in the world."", ""Busy dying or busy living? **Yes, there are SPOILERS here**This film has had such an emotional impact on me, I find it hard to write comments on it.  I've read a lot of the previous comments; all those that gush and eulogise as well as those who think it's over-rated or cliched. Most have got good points to make, however the thing that I think everyone is struggling to both explain and come to terms with is just why this film is *so* loved.  Loved to the extent that for many it is an almost spiritual experience or for those of a more secular nature like myself, loved as one of the most devastatingly uplifting things that can happen to you while watching a film.So I'm not going to review it, I'm just going to struggle in my own way to explain this film.  It took me a few viewings to get why I connect with it so deeply, but here goes.Many people in this world are unhappy.  Most people in this world don't want to be unhappy.  Lots of people wish, pray and above all hope for that magic wand to wave and wash them of their fears, losses, angers and pains once and for all.  They see lots of other people seemingly in this magical state, while they suffer.  To borrow the words of another film, they're watching the bluebirds flying over the rainbow.Many unhappy people have learned that the magic wand doesn't exist. They're not destined to join the bluebirds and fairytales don't come true.  It's not that no one lives happily ever after, it's just that they're not going to. They're busy dying.In this film, or as some people have quite correctly said, this fairytale, magic wands exist.  And that magic wand is Andy Dufrense imitating Houdini. However this film is not about him.  Neither is it about the prison, the governor, the guard, the plot, the acting, the cinematography, the script, the direction or the score.It's about Red.  He is the one who has become institutionally unhappy, he's not only trapped in a prison, not only has he given up on the idea of ever leaving, not only does he have no hope, he knows that if the miracle would ever happen to him, he couldn't cope.  He's safe in his unhappiness and that security is what keeps him going.  Hope is, as Red say, dangerous.  The metaphor for a certain illness here is very clear to me and I know that a rather large number of people suffer from it.  A large proportion of those don't understand what's wrong, but they certainly can recognise a fellow sufferer.  Those who are mercifully untouched by this illness definitely don't understand what's going on in those who do.  They're too busy living.The miracle in this film is not only that Red is redeemed but that the world outside the prison isn't all warm and sandy and sunny and with excellent fishing.  Some of it is rocky and uncertain.  Fairytales don't get this far. They'd end as Red left the gates of the prison and the credits would say 'and he lived happily ever after'.  This is the only film I can currently think of where they show how to get to the living happily ever after bit from your redemption via the rocky and uncertain ground of bagging groceries at the local store.  In other words, they're not going to cheat you and tell you everything's going to be alright.This is crucial.  For two and half hours, those of us who are quite content to mooch around our own personal prisons can see an escape route quite different to Andy's mapped out on the screen.  And it's a real way out. It's hard and upsetting, but ultimately rewarding.  The high you get from finding out and knowing that is only comparable diamorphine.The trouble is, if you're already busy living, this film won't mean that much and you'll see it a little more clearly than those busy dying.  To those fortunate individuals, watch this film and understand what the rest of us are going through.So, yes, this film is a cliched fairytale and maybe as a story it isn't realistic and at second on the IMDb all time list, it is a bit over-rated. However if you could have a chart of films listing the number of lives saved, altered and improved, the Shawshank Redemption would be way out in front at number one."", 'Hope can set you free and so can this remarkable film One of my favorite movies ever,The Shawshank Redemption is a modern day classic as it tells the story of two inmates who become friends and find solace over the years in which this movie takes place.Based on a Stephen King novel,this movie makes us feel different watching this film than most others as this is an incredibly realistic film.Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne who is convicted of murder and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding who is a fellow inmate and close friend of Dufresne and Bob Gunton as Warden Samuel Norton who is the Warden of Shawshank State Prison and is a character who has mixed feelings and emotions towards everyone around him and a character who is sometimes easy to like and at other times easy to despise.This film is easily considered one of the greatest films of all time and I definitely agree with this fact.It was nominated for seven Academy Awards including (Best Picture, Best Actor \x96 Morgan Freeman, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Score, and Best Sound) but didn\'t win any due to tough competition from the film Forrest Gump.I personally think that Tim Robbins should have been nominated for the Best Actor award as he really gave the performance of his career.Bravo to this brilliant modern day classic!', ""A movie revolution upon all others We have all see movies, comedies, action and dramas. We all liked ones, hated others, got into some other even and felt like part of it. In Shawshank Redemption; you start slowly, after a while you get attached, by the time you reach the middle of the movie you simply totally forget about anything outside the screen and feel a mixed stream of emotions going through you head before anything else! then comes a last 20 minutes of heart storming that is surely enough to raise the adrenaline to extreme levels even in diabetics! I felt warm, strong, happy and all other emotions one can think of, I felt I was the one who won, who got out of prison, i was simply fully satisfied.This movie must be used as an Anti-depression by therapists! this movie proves that Oscars are either money bought gifts! or that who ever in charge of them are so smart that they couldn't give any Oscar to The Shawshank Redemption knowing that the movie is on different - much higher- rating scale than the Oscars.. it's simply over qualified!"", 'Awesome movie - The Shawshank Redemption (1994) It\'s very rare that you find such diversity in a movie now days. I like the story and it\'s concept.A thumping good ode to friendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twister of twists since ""The Crying Game."" The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful and uplifting, not to mention Oscar-worthy film. In 2006, it was ranked as the greatest film ever by Empire, a film magazine. The year it came out it was nominated for 7 academy awards but did not win a single one because of a movie you may all remember, Forrest Gump. It\'s the no-bull performances that hold back the flood of banalities. Robbins and Freeman connect with the bruised souls of Andy and Red to create something undeniably powerful and moving. Some of ""The Shawshank Redemption\'\' comes across as outrageously improbable. Yet the film keeps pulling you back with its sense of striving humanity slowly turning the tables against evil.', 'My own personal view I don\'t care if there are some poor souls who would like to belittle this film. Just think of these misfits as beyond redemption.I saw this film in 1995 and still vividly felt the euphoria of the final half hour which stayed with me for a couple of weeks.I was convinced this was the best film I had ever seen in my life, even better than Akira Kurosawa\'s Ran and One flew over the cuckoo\'s nest, which was my all time favorite until TSR came along.I excitedly contacted my best friend who shared the same passion and he confirmed my thoughts,""this must be the best film I\'ve ever seen!"" But it is sad though that I will probably never see a better film for the rest of my life as I have seen the best.In music I have heard the best in Rush and Jackson Browne which made others pale in comparison and in movies I have TSR.Hail Frank Darabont!', ""What a touching movie ! It is really amazing movie i have ever seen in my lifetime. The cast and the story of the movie are really successful. Andy is a passionate character, and he is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. It is so touching to spend almost two decades in the prison. Old-fashioned prisons in the 90s are full of bad guy who don't expect anything from the life. And , they don't think how we escape here. However; Andy with his close friend in the prison , Red , tries redemption from this prison, by the time , Andy tries to do beneficial things for people in the prison not to attract attention. It is unbelievable that they escape from this prison. But , Andy approaches to place of exit. It is actually amazing , it is really incredible. They go to their dreams to live a peaceful and quiet life. Also; Andy prepares a trap for the chief of the jail. After the redemption , they become free anymore. It is really an amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well!"", 'Great story, wondrously told and acted At the heart of this extraordinary movie is a brilliant and indelible performance by Morgan Freeman as Red, the man who knows how to get things, the ""only"" guilty man at Shawshank prison. He was nominated by the Academy for Best Actor in 1995 but didn\'t win. (Tom Hanks won for Forrest Gump.) What Freeman does so beautifully is to slightly underplay the part so that the eternal boredom and cynicism of the lifer comes through, and yet we can see how very much alive with the warmth of life the man is despite his confinement. Someday Morgan Freeman is going to win an Academy Award and it will be in belated recognition for this performance, which I think was a little too subtle for some Academy members to fully appreciate at the time.But Freeman is not alone. Tim Robbins plays the hero of the story, banker Andy Dufresne, who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Robbins has a unique quality as an actor in that he lends ever so slightly a bemused irony to the characters he plays. It is as though part of him is amused at what he is doing. I believe this is the best performance of his career, but it might be compared with his work in The Player (1992), another excellent movie, and in Mystic River (2003) for which he won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor.It is said that every good story needs a villain, and in the Bible-quoting, Bible-thumping, massively hypocritical, sadistic Warden Samuel Norton, played perfectly by Bob Gunton, we have a doozy. I want to tell you that Norton is so evil that fundamentalist Christians actually hate this movie because of how precisely his vile character is revealed. They also hate the movie because of its depiction of violent, predatory homosexual behavior (which is the reason the movie is rated R). On the wall of his office (hiding his safe with its ill-gotten contents and duplicitous accounts) is a framed plaque of the words ""His judgment cometh and that right soon."" The irony of these words as they apply to the men in the prison and ultimately to the warden himself is just perfect. You will take delight, I promise.Here is some other information about the movie that may interest you. As most people know, it was adapted from a novella by Stephen King entitled ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption."" Rita Hayworth figures in the story because Red procures a poster of her for Andy that he pins up on the wall of his cell. The poster is a still from the film Gilda (1946) starring her and Glenn Ford. We see a clip from the black and white film as the prisoners watch, cheering and hollering when Rita Hayworth appears. If you haven\'t seen her, check out that old movie. She really is gorgeous and a forerunner of Marilyn Monroe, who next appears on Andy\'s wall in a still from The Seven Year Itch (1955). It\'s the famous shot of her in which her skirt is blown up to reveal her shapely legs. Following her on Andy\'s wall (and, by the way, these pinups figure prominently in the plot) is Rachel Welsh from One Million Years B.C. (1966). In a simple and effective device these pinups show us graphically how long Andy and Red have been pining away.Frank Darabont\'s direction is full of similar devices that clearly and naturally tell the story. There is Brooks (James Whitmore) who gets out after fifty years but is so institutionalized that he can\'t cope with life on the outside and hangs himself. Playing off of this is Red\'s periodic appearance before the parole board where his parole is summarily REJECTED. Watch how this plays out at the end.The cinematography by Roger Deakins is excellent. The editing superb: there\'s not a single dead spot in the whole movie. The difference between the good guys (Red, Andy, Brooks, etc.) and the bad guys (the warden, the guards, the ""sisters,"" etc.) is perhaps too starkly drawn, and perhaps Andy is a bit too heroic and determined beyond what might be realistic, and perhaps the ""redemption"" is a bit too miraculous in how beautifully it works out. But never mind. We love it.All in all this is a great story vividly told that will leave you with a true sense of redemption in your soul. It is not a chick flick, and that is an understatement. It is a male bonding movie about friendship and the strength of character, about going up against what is wrong and unfair and coming out on top through pure true grit and a little luck.Bottom line: one of the best ever made, currently rated #2 (behind The Godfather) at the IMDb. Don\'t miss it.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can\'t Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)', ""The closest thing to poetic perfection Hollywood has ever produced This touching and heart warming film is the most perfect celebration of the human spirit I have seen. Andy Dufresne, wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, finds the strength not only to change himself, but to bring hope to those around him in Shawshank Prison.  This inspiring story is interwoven with a soundtrack which invokes every emotion, from haunting and chilling, to stirring and beautiful. When you go to see a movie and it touches you with its poetry, music, and its atmosphere, and leaves you with a sense of victorious satisfaction, it is a triumph.  Field of Dreams was the first movie which invoked these emotions in me.  Shawshank Redemption is even more powerful for its simplicity.  It doesn't pretend to be clean, nor could it be called a family movie.  It is brutal and violent at times, horrifying and sickening at others. However the title says it all. Redemption is what this story is all about.  And it is not necessarily redemption for the actual crimes you might have committed, but it is redemption for the way you have lived your life.  What emerges can only be called a maginificent piece of art.  This is what movies were meant to be."", 'Richly human, uplifting Deservedly ranked at the top of IMDb\'s all-time best 250 films ever.The casting is superb: Morgan Freeman is ""Red,"" a wise observer of people and an entrepreneur inmate who\'s made ""connections"" so he can get contraband to other inmates for a price; he\'s under a life sentence for murder. Tim Robbins is ""Andy,"" a smart banker and accounting whiz who was sentenced to 2 life terms for killing his wife and her lover (which he--like most other inmates, say they\'re not guilty of). And Bob Gunton is ""Warden Norton"" who, when we first meet him, is touting the virtues of Bible reading and strict discipline. While, fortunately, I\'ve had no first hand experience, ""Shawshank"" certainly gives the feel of authenticity of prison life and its society.A long movie, most of it takes place inside a semi-corrupt state penitentiary in the late 1940s. ""Red,"" in talking his thoughts out loud to himself, becomes our narrator for many developments. As the story unfolds, increasingly we come to see Andy as a person with strong personal values which he upholds in the most difficult situations. And in Andy\'s work for Warden Norton, we also increasingly find the warden as morally his opposite: selfish and fundamentally lacking decent moral character--all show and appearance and with no integrity, substance.In Roger Ebert\'s first review (of his two) of this movie, he said: ""....the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything....the word redemption is in the title for a reason...."" Most viewers will agree.', ""the Shawshank redemption is a world class film the Shawshank redemption should be played throughout the world in all schools to teach people the hard life of prison but the bond between friends and the idea of hope. Morgan freeman is a second to none actor he lays the role perfectly and i could not think what the film would be like without him. all the other actors perform perfectly. this movie is a movie of inspiration and one of which will get people through harsh times. this film always restores my faith in mankind i simply love it. I first saw this film sitting on my brothers desk and i was intrigued by the idea of a film set in prison where hope and other morale values were the storyline instead of violence and havoc, this is a amazing film which brings pride to the actors and crew who produced it. the setting of the movie is one of perfection the Gothic grounds and the stunning facilities astound me i'am finding it hard to put in to words how much this film means to me i would say it is one of the greatest film's ever made in my time and i love it."", ""Hope......Don't loose it at any cost The 'Shawshank Redemption' undoubtedly deserves to be the highest rated movie. The movie depicts how a four lettered word 'Hope' brings wonders to our lives and makes something impossible to possible.Though the plot of the movie focuses on how Andy Dufrane, a falsely convicted prisoner gets out of the prison, the beauty of the movie lies in the characterization of Andy Dufrane (just amazing) and how he influences his fellow prisoner 'Red'. The narration by Morgan Freeman in the role of 'Red' is perhaps one of the best narrations i have ever come across. This story proves that the king of horrors, Stephen King, is equally good at any other genre of 'Story Writing'(Hats off). The dialogues towards the end of the movie about hope are truly inspiring. The background score of the movie is excellent. Tom Robbins and Morgan Freeman at their best in the roles of Andy Dufrane and Red respectively.Didn't watch the movie??...go grab a DVD and watch it as soon as possible. Can't miss a movie like this...."", ""What a movie!!! I totally adored the concept of hope in this film. I love how the director portrays the Shawshank tyrants as corrupt murderers, that's pretty much what they are and serve as the grounds for the escape of Andy. Now Morgan Freeman's got talent, I love that guy he may not be the greatest out there but he is a force to be reckoned with on the set. I loved how he gave the story flavor with his descriptions of characters and perceptions of how life was in lonely jail cells of Shawshank. You know there's a lot more to say about this movie, it's too good too be true. Especially the ending which by the way brought tears to eyes, the most moving scene!!! Overall it was superb and all thanks to Stephen King for putting this in the form of alphabets in the first place. I'm starting to regret not reading any of his novels.

The fascinating performance of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, the direction, and everything puts you in the place of the actors, making you feel the way they felt. This movie doesn't have any dirty romance or impossible actions, rather, it focuses on a greater philosophy - Hope to live when there is no hope, survival -- This is one movie, that will leave you talking about it even many days after watching.

(Hence, the lack of academy awards.) However, when all those elements are combined, Shawshank becomes one of those masterpieces which is greater than the sum of its parts...and this film is so much greater that in the desperation of its characters, it invokes a multitude of good emotions in the viewer...that there is divine, poetic justice and hope in this hell of a world.Shawshank has become my favorite film of all time, but it took a while. ""When your\'re feeling down and out, watch Shawshank!"" Raising my vote from 8/10 to 10/10 (however subjective that vote may be.)', 'One of the greatest movies of all time The first time I saw ""The Shawshank Redemption"" I was only 12. At the time I was amazed at how a movie could present so much emotion. As I have grown, my taste in movies has also. Still, I rank ""Shawshank"" as my favorite film, the one that I could watch every day for the rest of my life. If you have not seen this film, I pity you. Do not just rent it at your local Blockbuster. I implore you step away from your computer, go out to the nearest store, and buy this movie. Not only do Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins give performances that will make you question your humanity, but you will most definitely learn something that will benefit you as a person.

The acting is just so passionate and their performances increases the drama and horror of life in prison. The soundtrack is one of the main reason behind the emotional drama this movie. Many scenes in this movie almost left me in tears mainly because of the soundtrack in the background which increases the emotion. The cast of this movie include Academy Awards winners Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.

Cinematography exquisitely captures the monotonous daily life inside prison. The bond that grows between the two main characters is unforgettable and the score is the best I have heard. Morgan Freeman makes us feel the sadness and Tim Robbins, the faith. The more times you watch it, the more you love it, and the more you learn from it. Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest film. It has everything you could possibly want in a movie.

The only exception was early in 2002 when FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING topped the chart for a couple of months then dropped down to number 2 for a couple of more months . I`ll probably make myself very unpopular for saying this but I don`t think SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION deserves to be so high !!!!!! SPOILERS !!!!!!What I don`t like about it is the amount of cliches . New prisoner arrives and finds a maggot in his food , prison cliche 37 . New prisoner gives maggot to old prisoner to feed his pet bird , prison cliche 43 . It`s revealed at the end that the prisoner who has spent so many years inside is innocent after all , prison cliche numero uno . Did anyone believe during any part of this movie that Andy Dufresne was guilty ? Neither did I . Maybe that`s why I love the American prison series OZ because all the inmates there are totally guilty . There`s other things wrong with the movie . It`s about half an hour overlong , and there`s rather unrealistic bits like the warder having someone killed after finding out Dufresne is probably innocent. Oh and how many prison friendships has there been between a black man and a white man ? Maybe that last point shouldn`t be taken as a criticism because the performances of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are very good and make the movie . Neither of them give a flashy performance ( Again not a criticism ) but both are very subtle in their roles , can you imagine how different this movie would have been if we`d had Tom Cruise and Denzil Washington as the stars ? Perhaps because Freeman`s character of Red does seem to have been written as a white character he`s so good in the role . Am I alone in thinking Freeman has been the best black actor in Hollywood for the last decade because he`s more interested in exploring the character instead of playing someone who`s black ? There`s also some outstanding touches from director Frank Darabont . Witness the scene early in the film where Andy spends his first night in prison with the darkness falling upon the prisoners faces . It`s almost like the artwork of Andy Dogg as the prisoners look out onto the landing as they search for fresh prey , and there is quite a touching sequence as Red leaves prison out into the harsh outside world to the strains of Thomas Newman`s scoreI gave THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION eight out of ten . It is a classic feel good movie but unfortunately being a cynic I do think it`s slightly overrated by IMDB voters', ""The greatest movie ever made..! The greatest movie ever made..! Period. Pure and simple, it is what every director hope to achieve. The film will keep you glued to your seat if you know what it means.It will bring tears to your eyes.

This includes some of Hollywood's best critics including EW's Owen Gleiberman who originally gave the film a B- back in late '94. Yet over time, this story of redemption, like the rise of hope this film gives from beginning to end, grows on you to the point where at the very end, you have no choice but to clap (I clapped in my basement in front of my parents and I haven't looked the same since). Darabont found a formula that worked and it shows in his future films. He made Robbins human, made Morgan Freeman's voice as American as a Big Mac and made the late great Rita Hayworth relevant again. The only regret that one should have is the fact that if it was released two years later it would've swept away the Oscars (Sorry Ralph Fiennes, The English Patient won on a weak year.)"", ""Mystery I still can't quite get the enormous reputation of this film. I saw it again last night and instead of clearing up the mystery, the mystery got thicker. It is enjoyable film with very good performances by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore etc, but...the most highly rated film ever? I don't get it. The voice over alone seems to belong to a so so film. I love Morgan Freeman's voice but he's telling us what we're seeing. So, the sterling reputation damages the enjoyment of the film because one is expecting something that never, really, arrives. The most interesting aspect is Tim Robbins's psychological journey. Credible or incredible doesn't quite matter, I did go with him without asking too many questions. Morgan Freeman's humanity is contagious and inspiring, whether credible or not because I bought it. So, a masterpiece? No. Good, even very good? Yes."", 'do I want to write the 234th comment on Do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.', 'The shortest long movie I\'ve ever seen. Kept me wanting more and more, minute by minute. At first, before starting the movie, I thought ""Sounds like a typical prison riot and break-out kind of movie"". At the beginning of the movie, my thoughts was even more convincing. A large prison (Which immediately reminded me of the movie ""The Last Castle"" from 2001), housing people of all sorts, having it\'s guards, warden and of course, the inmates. The typical inmate; Roughneck, hard on the outside, broken on the inside. And they all claim their innocence, as an internal joke sort of speak.It gets to a point where I started comparing it with others. That proved wrong in quite a short while, from the point where a prisoner, framed for murder of his wife and her lover, is being convicted and sentenced to life in prison. His name was Andy Dufresne. In short terms, a straight-up bank employee, excellent with numbers and taxes, which he also uses to benefit within the walls of the prison. His reputation as a numerological genius spreads out, and soon all kinds of people, inmates and guards, are coming to him for financial advice. He builds up a library, he maintains a strict surface. He has his hobbies, to keep his mind busy (as said in the movie). He carves chess pieces out of stone, using an axe as the tool. Seemingly, this is a nice and lucrative hobby, but underneath it all, he has a secret...The movie keeps the viewer thrilled and excited, because in every minute, something could happen. The dialog is good, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, both great actors, shows and outstanding play. The crew really did good work on the set, the right camera angles, the light, sounds and so on...it was almost like I could smell the prison!A brilliant movie. Not too short, not too long. It\'s worth every minute watching! My highest recommendation for those who like drama, action and humor.', 'prison escape This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you...', ""An astonishing tale of endurance, courage, life, and perspective.. At the time of writing this comment, IMDb ranks the Shawshank Redemption as No. 2 in top 250 best movies of all time. Let me tell you that this is no exaggeration and no small feat given IMDb's strict rating criteria. Shawshank is indeed, up there amongst the best, and if you haven't seen it yet, you should make it a point to watch it, at least once sometime in your life. For it is an astonishing tale, of endurance, courage, life, and perspective, combined with a stunning score that flows so closely with the highs and lows of emotion that it could make grown men cry. No words can explain how good Shawshank really is, but let the sheer volume of good user reviews made by devotees in this website be proof enough of its greatness.""]"	"In 1947, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker in Maine, is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, a golf pro. Since the state of Maine has no death penalty, he is given two consecutive life sentences and sent to the notoriously harsh Shawshank Prison. Andy keeps claiming his innocence, but his cold and measured demeanor led many to doubt his words.Meanwhile, Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman), known as Red is being interrogated by the parole commission to consider granting him parole after having spent 20 years at Shawshank for murder. Despite his best efforts and behavior, Red's parole is rejected which doesn't affect him all that much. Red is then introduced as the local smuggler who can get inmates anything they want within reason. An alarm then goes off alerting all prisoners of new arrivals. Red and his friends bet on whichever new fish will have a nervous break down during his first night in prison. Red places a huge bet on Andy.During the first night, an overweight newly arrived inmate, nicknamed ''fat ass', breaks down and cries hysterically allowing Heywood (William Sadler) to win the bet. However, the celebration is short lived when the chief guard, Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), savagely beats up the fat man for being unable to keep quiet. Meanwhile, Andy remains steadfast and composed. The next morning, the inmates learn that ''fat ass'' died in the infirmary because the prison doctor had left for the night. Andy inquires about the man's name only to be chastised by Heywood.About a month later, Andy approaches Red having heard of his talents for finding things. He asks Red to find him a rock hammer, an instrument he claims is necessary for his hobby of rock collecting and sculpting. Red asks a few questions about his intentions which Andy laughs off. Red agrees to place the order and also warns Andy about ''the sisters'', a group of prisoners who sexually assaults other prisoners, most importantly their leader, Boggs (Mark Rolston) who has developed a crush on Andy. Though other prisoners consider Andy ""a really cold fish,"" Red sees something in Andy, and likes him from the start. Red believes Andy intends to use the hammer to engineer his escape in the future but when the tool arrives and he sees how small it is, Red understands why Andy laughed and laughs too, putting aside the thought that Andy could ever use it to dig his way out of prison.During the first two years of his incarceration, Andy spends most of his time working in the prison laundry or fighting off Boggs and his goons. Though he persistently resists and fights them, Andy is beaten and raped on a regular basis but keeps quiet about it.When a work detail for tarring the roof of one of the prison's buildings is announced, Red pulls some strings to get Andy and a few of their mutual friends assigned to the job, giving everyone a break from the usual. During the job Andy overhears Hadley complaining about having to pay taxes for an upcoming inheritance. Drawing on his expertise as a banker, Andy lets Hadley know how he can shelter his money from the IRS by turning it into a one-time gift for his wife. He then offers to assist Hadley in filling out all the proper forms in exchange for some cold beers for his fellow inmates while on the tarring job. Though he at first threatens to throw Andy off the roof, Hadley, the most brutal guard in the prison, agrees, providing the men with cold beer before the job is finished. Red remarks that Andy may have engineered the privilege to build favor with the prison guards as much as with his fellow inmates, but he also thinks Andy did it simply to ""feel normal again.""While watching a movie, Andy approaches Red with another unusual demand and asks for the famed actress Rita Hayworth. Red is surprised but agrees to place the order. Soon after, Andy once more encounters the Sisters and avoids rape but is brutally beaten within an inch of his life, putting him in the infirmary for a month. Boggs spends a week in solitary for the beating. When he comes out, he finds Hadley and his men waiting in his cell. They beat him so badly that he's left unable to walk or eat solid food for the rest of his life and is transferred to a prison hospital upstate. The Sisters move on and never bother Andy again. When Andy gets out of the infirmary, he finds a bunch of rocks for him to sculpt and a giant poster of Rita Hayworth in his cell; presents from Red and his buddies.Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) hears about how Andy helped Hadley and uses a surprise cell inspection to size Andy up. He finds Andy reading his copy of the Holy Bible and they talk about their favorite verses while the guards are turning the cell upside down looking for illegal possessions. Satisfied with their encounter, the warden leaves and almost forget to give his Bible back to Andy. He then encourages Andy to keep reading the Bible saying that ''Salvation lays within''. Andy is later advised that he will now work in the prison library with aging inmate Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore). The reason for his transfer is made obvious when a prison guard shows up asking Andy for financial advice. Andy sets-up a makeshift desk and starts working, providing financial advice to most prison guards and helping them with their income tax returns. Andy also sees an opportunity to expand the prison library; he starts by asking the Maine state senate for funds. He writes letters every week. His financial support practice is so appreciated that even guards from other prisons, when they visit for inter-prison baseball matches, seek Andy's financial advice. Even the warden himself has Andy preparing his tax returns.Not long afterwards, Brooks snaps and threatens to kill Heywood in order to avoid being paroled. Andy is able to talk him down and Brooks is paroled. When his friends discuss Brooks 'behavior, Red tells them that Brooks has obviously become ""institutionalized,"" after spending 50 years at Shawshank. He has become essentially conditioned to be a prisoner for the rest of his life and is unable to adapt to the outside world. Red remarks: ""These walls are funny. First you hate 'em, then you get used to 'em. Enough time passes, you get so you depend on them."" Brooks goes to a halfway house and is given a job but hates both and finds it impossible to adjust to life outside the prison. He eventually commits suicide, leaving the message ""Brooks was here"" carved on a wooden beam .After six years of writing letters, Andy receives $200 from the state for the library, along with a collection of old books and phonograph records. Though the state Senate thinks this will be enough to get Andy to halt his letter-writing campaign, he is undaunted and redoubles his efforts.When the donations of old books and records arrive at the warden's office, Andy finds a copy of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro among the records. He locks the guard assigned to the warden's office in the bathroom and plays the record over the prison's PA system. The entire prison is soon captivated by the music. Red remarks that the voices of these women made everyone feel free, if only for a brief time. Outside the office, Norton appears, furious at the act of defiance, and orders Andy to turn off the record player. Andy reaches for the needle arm at first, and then turns the volume on the phonograph up. The warden orders Hadley to break into the office and Andy is sent immediately to solitary confinement for two weeks. When he gets out, he tells his friends that the stretch was the ""easiest time"" he ever did in the hole because he spent it with Mozart's Figaro stuck in his head for comfort. When the other prisoners tell him how unlikely that is, he talks about the power that hope can have in prison and that hope can sustain them. Red strongly disagrees with Andy, claiming that hope is a dangerous thing in a place like Shawshank and tells Andy he should get used to living without it. Andy implies that this is exactly what Brooks did and Red leaves the table angry.Not long after, Red has a new parole hearing and realizes he's been in prison for 30 years now. He uses the exact same words he used ten years earlier only with no enthusiasm at all. His parole is rejected again. Andy gives him an harmonica to commemorate his 30 years which Red replies by offering Andy a giant poster of Marilyn Monroe to commemorate his 10 years.About 4 years after the Mozart incident, the state senate finally comes to the conclusion that they won't get rid of Andy with just another check. So they allow him a budget of 500$ a year to build his library. Andy uses it wisely and makes deals with book clubs and charities to create the best prison library in the state and names it after Brooks. With the enlarged library and more materials, Andy begins to mentor inmates who want to receive their high school diplomas.Meanwhile, Warden Norton profits on Andy's knowledge of accounting and devises a scheme whereby he puts prison inmates to work in public projects which he wins by outbidding other contractors (prisoners are cheap labor). Occasionally, he allows other contractors to score projects as long as the bribe is good enough. Andy launders money for the warden by setting up many accounts in different banks, along with several investments, using the fake identity of Randall Stephens, a man who only exist on papers, created by Andy himself through his knowledge of the system and mail ordered forms. Randall Stephens officially has a birth certificate, social security number and driving license. Should anyone ever investigate about the scheme; they will chase a man who only exist on paper. Andy only shares the details with Red, noting that he had to ""go to prison to learn how to be a crook.""In 1965, a young prisoner named Tommy (Gil Bellows) comes to Shawshank to serve time for breaking and entering. Tommy is easy going, charismatic, and popular among the other inmates. When Tommy explains that he's been going in and out of prison ever since he was 13 years old, Andy suggests that Tommy takes up another line of work besides theft because he seems to be not so good at it. The suggestion really gets to Tommy and he asks Andy to help him work on earning his high school equivalency diploma. Though Tommy is a good student, he is still frustrated when he takes the exam itself, crumpling it up and tossing it in the trash. Andy retrieves it and sends it in anyway. One day Tommy asks Red about Andy's case which Red explains. Upon hearing the story, Tommy is visibly upset. He then tells Andy and Red the story of a former cellmate from another prison who boasted about killing a man who was a pro golfer at the country club he worked at, along with his lover. The woman's husband, a banker, had gone to prison for those murders.With this new information, Andy, full of hope, meets with the warden, expecting Norton to help him get a new trial with Tommy as a witness. The reaction from Norton is completely contrary to what Andy hoped for. When Andy says emphatically that he would never reveal the money laundering schemes he set up for Norton over the years, the warden becomes furious and orders him to solitary for a month. The inmates discuss the sentence mentioning it is the longest time in solitary that they've ever heard of. They also realize that Andy may truly be innocent after all and has spent almost 20 years in prison for a crime he didn't commit.Tommy receives a letter from the board of education announcing that he has passed the exam and now owns a high school diploma. A guard pass the news to Andy in his solitary cell which makes him smile a little.Later on, Tommy is escorted outside at night to have a private meeting with the warden. The warden asks him if the story he told Andy is true and if he would be willing to testify on Andy's behalf. Tommy enthusiastically agrees. The warden smiles at him before nodding to Hadley to shoot him dead.When the warden visits Andy in solitary, he tells him that Tommy tried to escape and that Hadley had no choice but to shoot him. Andy tells Norton that ''everything'' stops and that he's not going to work for the warden anymore. The warden threatens Andy to shut down the library, burn all the books, and move Andy to a much different cell in a much different part of the prison with the most hardened criminals should he stop working for him. He then leaves and orders Andy to another month in solitary to think about things.When Andy finally comes out of solitary, he and Red have a conversation where Andy talks about his wife and how much he loved her and feels responsible for her death even though he didn't pulled the trigger. He then talks about his projects should he ever get out of prison. He talks about Zihuatanejo, a beach town on the Pacific coast of Mexico where he'd like to live for the rest of his life and manage a hotel there. He then asks Red if he'd join him to which Red says no and that he believes he is too far gone like Brooks. He then criticizes Andy for allowing hope to mess with his mind like that and that it will only destroy him. Andy agrees and is about to leave when he asks Red if he knows the Buxton, Maine area. He then tells Red about a very specific hay field where there is a large oak tree at the end of a stone wall. He then asks Red to promise him that, should he ever get paroled, he will seek that oak tree and retrieve something that was hidden among the stones but refuses to say what it is. Red promises but is worried about his friend's state of mind. His worries are pushed even further when he learns that Andy has asked Haywood for a 6 foot rope. Red believes Andy may have finally reached his breaking point and is about to commit suicide. Meanwhile, Norton asks Andy to shine his shoes for him and put his suit in for dry-cleaning before retiring for the night. Andy returns to his cell and the guards turn the lights off for the night. Red remarks that it was the longest night of his life.The following morning, Andy has not answered the morning call and is not standing in front of his cell like every morning. The guard yells at Andy for putting him late and walks to his cell expecting to find a seriously sick or dead Andy. At the same time, Norton becomes alarmed when he finds Andy's shoes in his shoe box instead of his own. The alarm then goes off announcing a missing inmate. Norton rushes to Andy's cell and demands an explanation. Hadley brings in Red, but Red insists he knows nothing of Andy's plans. Becoming increasingly hostile and paranoid, Norton starts throwing Andy's sculpted rocks around the cell. When he throws one at Andy's poster of Raquel Welch (in the spot previously occupied by Marilyn Monroe, and before that by Rita Hayworth), the rock punches through and into the wall. Norton tears the poster away from the wall and finds a tunnel just wide enough for a man to crawl into.During the previous night's thunderstorm, Andy wore Norton's shoes to his cell, catching a lucky break when no one notices, including Red. He packed many of his belongings, some papers and Norton's clothes into a plastic bag, tied it to himself with the rope he'd asked for, and escaped through his hole. The tunnel he'd excavated led him to a space between two walls of the prison where he found a sewer main line. Using a rock, he hit the sewer line in time with the lightning strikes and eventually burst it. After crawling through 500 yards of the raw sewage contained in the pipe, Andy emerged in a brook outside the walls. A search team later found his prison clothes, a bar of soap and a very worn out rock hammer.While the warden and Red are discovering Andy's genius escape, Andy walks into the Maine National Bank in Portland, where he had put Norton's money. Using his assumed identity as Randall Stephens, and with all the necessary documentation, he closes the account and walks out with a cashier's check. Before he leaves, he asks them to drop a package in the mail. He continues his visitations to nearly a dozen other local banks, ending up with some $370,000. The package contains Warden Norton's accounting books, which are delivered straight to the Portland Daily Bugle newspaper along with Andy's written confessions and testimony.Not long after, the police storm Shawshank Prison. Hadley is arrested for murder; Red says he was taken away ""crying like a little girl."" Warden Norton finally opens his safe, which he hadn't touched since Andy escaped, and instead of his books, he finds the Bible he had given Andy with a note to the warden saying that he was right, ""salvation did lay within"". Norton then opens it to the book of Exodus and finds that the pages have all been cut out in the shape of Andy's rock hammer. Norton walks back to his desk as the police pound on his door, takes out a small revolver and shoots himself in the head. Red remarks that he wondered if the warden thought, right before pulling the trigger, how ""Andy could ever have gotten the best of him.""Shortly after, Red receives a postcard from Fort Hancock, Texas, with nothing written on it. Red takes it as a sign that Andy made it into Mexico to freedom. Red and his buddies kill time talking about Andy's exploits (with a few embellishments), but Red falls into a sort of depression from missing his friend.At Red's next parole hearing in 1967, he talks to the parole board about how ""rehabilitated"" is just a made-up word invented to justify their job. He then explains how much he regrets his actions of the past, not because he's in jail but because he knows how wrong it was. He then closes by saying that he has to live with that for the rest of his life and ask the board to stop wasting his time and leave him alone. His parole is granted this time. He goes to live and work at the same places that Brooks did, even seeing Brooks 'message carved into the wooden beam. He frequently walks by a pawn shop which has several guns in the window. At times he contemplates trying to get back into prison feeling that he has no life outside of prison where he has spent most of his adult life, but he remembers the promise he made to Andy. He then reveals that he was not looking at the guns but at the compasses behind the guns and he bought one.Red follows Andy's instructions, hitchhiking to Buxton and finding the stone wall Andy described. Just as Andy said, there is a large black stone. Underneath is a small box containing a large sum of cash and instructions to come find him in Zihuatanejo although he doesn't name the city just in case. He also says he needs somebody ""who can get things"" for a ""project"" of his. Red suddenly understands all the power of hope and feels exhilarated by the feelings inside of him.After carving a new message in the wooden beam which reads: ""Brooks was here, so was Red"", Red violates parole and leaves the halfway house, unconcerned since no one is likely to do an extensive manhunt for ""an old crook like [him]."" He takes a bus to Fort Hancock, where he crosses into Mexico. The two friends are finally reunited on a beach of the Pacific coast, just like Andy had been hoping for."

And I see films for free. I wouldn\'t be caught dead giving my hard earned money to these idiots.Well, to explain the depth of this \'film\', I could write my shortest review, ever. Don\'t see this movie. It is by far the stupidest, lamest, most lazy, and unbelievably UNFUNNY movie I have ever seen. It is a total disaster. But since my hatred for this movie, and the others like it, extends far beyond one viewing, I think I\'ll go on for a bit.I don\'t know any of the people in the movie besides Carmen Electra, Vanessa Minnillo, and Kim Kardashian, but it doesn\'t matter. They\'re all horrible, though I think that was the point. The editing is flat out horrible, and possibly blatant continuity errors make this crapfast even crappier than I thought it would be. Now I know that these films are not supposed to be serious at all, but come on, it\'s film-making 101 that if someone gets a minor facial cut, it should be there in the next shot. AND, if someone gets cut by a sword, there should be blood and at least a cut (though since the Narnia films ""get away with it"", I\'ll give Disaster Movie a pass here).The \'jokes\' are thoughtless and mindless physical gags that obviously take after some of the most popular movies of the last year (there\'s some from late 2007 as well, including 2 of our 5 Best Picture nominees).You know what the saddest thing about these stupid movies are? I don\'t care how much money they make, or how many cameos they have, these sorry ass excuses for films are taking away jobs from actors, writers, and directors that truly deserve the attention. Lionsgate, I thought you had better taste than this. You should be ashamed of yourselves for making this kind of crap. And as for Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer? Burn in hell. You guys are contributing to the decline of western civilization. Correction...you are the CAUSE of the downfall of western civilization.', 'There\'s just no point anymore Really, I could write a scathing review of this turd sandwich, but instead, I\'m just going to be making a few observations and points I\'ve deduced.There\'s just no point in watching these movies anymore. Does any reader out there remember Scary Movie? Remember how it was original with a few comedic elements to it? There was slapstick, some funny lines, it was a pretty forgettable comedy, but it was worth the price of admission. Well, That was the last time this premise was funny. STOP MAKING THESE MOVIES. PLEASE.I could call for a boycott of these pieces of monkey sh*t, but we all know there\'s going to be a line up of pre pubescent annoying little buggers, spouting crappy one liners like, ""THIS IS SPARTA!"" and, ""IM RICK JAMES BITCH"" so these movies will continue to make some form of monetary gain, considering the production value of this movie looks like it cost about 10 cents to make.Don\'t see this movie. Don\'t spend any money on it. Go home, rent Airplane, laugh your ass off, and then silently judge the people that are talking about this movie on Monday. Do yourself a favor.', 'Not Humorous...in the least bit I am writing this in hopes that this gets put over the previous review of this ""film"". How anyone can find this slop entertaining is completely beyond me. First of all a spoof film entitled ""Disaster Movie"", should indeed be a spoof on disaster films. Now I have seen 1 (yes count them, 1) disaster film being spoofed, that being ""Twister"". How does Juno, Iron Man, Batman, The Hulk, Alvin and the Chipmunks, Amy Winehouse, or Hancock register as Disaster films? Selzterwater and Failburg once again have shown that they lack any sort of writing skill and humor. Having unfortunately been tortured with Date Movie and Epic Movie I know exactly what to expect from these two...no plot, no jokes just bad references and cheaply remade scenes from other films. Someone should have informed them that satire is more than just copy and paste from one film to another, though I shouldn\'t say that because some of these actually just seem to be taken from trailers.There is nothing clever or witty or remotely smart about the way these two write, and I can\'t believe that some people still pay to see these travesties. It\'s an insult to the audience, though if they enjoy these films I doubt that they are smart enough to realize that.Rating: Unfortunately there is not a number low enough (yes this includes negatives) to rate this. This deserves to be in the top 5 worst films of all time, right there with Date Movie, Epic Faliure...I mean movie, and Meet the Spartans. I would rather be forced into a 24 hour ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"" marathon than watch this slop.', 'My Eyes!!!! It\'s hard to imagine anyone writing a \'spoof\' movie even worse than Meet the Spartans, but Seltzer and Friedberg have pulled it off. It\'s not even just a little worse. It makes Spartans look like Raiders of the Lost Ark in comparison. You will seriously feel ill afterwards and more than likely have a strong urge to gouge your eyes out.May Contain Spoilers....if you care: First off, as it appeared in the trailer, this movie does not spoof, or really even reference disaster movies at all. The set shakes a few times, there are some plastic asteroids, and a bad cgi tornado, all of which that do nothing to add anything to the movie, but other than this there\'s nothing even relating this to said style of film. Instead we get references (not to be confused with actual spoofs) to such films as High School Musical, Step Up, this summer\'s crop of comic based films, Enchanted, Alvin and the Chipmunks, Kung Fu Panda, and Sex and the City. I can\'t wait to hear Seltzer and Friedberg praise their own genius and describe this movie as being modeled around Cloverfield...they clearly tried to do this, but other than the outline of the small group of people running through the city trying to find the injured girlfriend, there\'s nothing relating this piece of crap to the monster movie.I can honestly say I did not laugh once at this movie. All of the ""jokes"" were forced, and many of them were dragged on for several minutes at a time...the two writers clearly thinking they were onto some kind of comedy gold here. Probably the most insulting thing about this movie is, like all their other gems: Epic, Date, Spartans, they consider the audience to be mentally challenged...having to tell us point blank what movie it is they are referencing (again...not spoofing) Such lines like: ""It\'s an inconvenient truth, it\'s global warming,"" ""Come here you kung fu panda,"" ""what is this enchanted place,"" ""How do you know all this? I know because I saw Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" ""Let me get my Get Smart phone (proceeds to talk on his shoe),"" and ""whats with the marching band? I thought I\'d cheer you up with a high school musical"" all exist to make sure we\'re in on their super intelligent antics.Please, save your money for anything else. Show Hollywood that they need to stop these two guys from making any more movies. I can\'t even imagine a 5 year old finding this stuff funny. Speaking of 5 years old, that\'s about how long many of these jokes will last before absolutely no one can find them funny anymore since, as usual, most of them are simply based on pop culture references.', 'Someone please put an end to Seltzer\'s awful career I was given a free ticket to this film; so I can\'t complain that I was ripped off (except in that some 90 minutes of my life were irretrievably stolen from me). These sort of movies (Date Movie, Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans) haven\'t been funny for some time now but ""Disaster Movie"" has reached a new low. There wasn\'t one real laugh anywhere in the film, and most of the alleged ""jokes"" were actually painful. (There was a considerable amount of childish, mean-spirited stuff in the form of racist, sexist, and especially homophobic, garbage present, along with ample helpings of juvenile gross-outs.) None of the actors were even bothering to put up any pretense of acting. There is nothing hip, clever, or even mildly intelligent going on here. The entire film is from beginning to end crass, vulgar, irrational, and utterly humorless in any human sense. I know that in the past these sort of trash has made enough money to keep Seltzer et al., grinding them out but ""Disaster Movie"" may just be the downfall of the franchise. The utter contempt that Seltzer and his collaborators have for their audience is finally beginning to show through clearly. If this one fails (and from what I saw in the almost empty theater there is a good chance of it), Seltzer will have to go back to the drawing board, stop making these lazy catastrophes, and finally develop a real sense of humor. This movie is an unfunny piece of puke - stay away from it.', 'Awful, pure stupidity This movie I saw a day early for free and I still feel like I got ripped off. It is totally brain dead. Burping, kicking in the groin and boobs all over the place. Lame. What is wrong with society, that films like this even get made? The parodies were all horrendous, and un-funny. The plot was lackluster at best and the acting was shallow, transparent and really quite unnecessary.Anyone see ""Idiocracy""? Remember the movie that won all the academy awards in the future? Well this is that movie. I have not seen a more rancid crappy film. ""Date Movie"" was okay, The Scary movies at least had decent plots, but this, this makes ""spoofs"" (if I can be so nice to call it that) for this year 0 for 3, with ""Meet the Spartans"" and ""Superhero Movie"" all falling flat.Well I\'ve wasted even more of my life typing about this sack of cow dung. So all in all, don\'t see this movie, unless of course your IQ is below 80.Thanks, R', 'Wait... What? Honestly, what is wrong with you, Hollywood? Not only is this the WORST thing that has happened to you ---- you keep funding these ""cheesy writers of Scary Movie"" to make these movies. I mean, come on Carmen Electra, you know even better than them that you have potential! Stop portraying in parody movies! See, I can\'t believe I am comparing ""parody"" to this movie. This movie has no ""parody"" or ""comedy"" in it, this is all referencing. All they need to do is see a movie title, take a line and a scene from a trailer, and turn it into a script. Never in my LIFE have I ever been so ticked off by you (Hollywood).I mean, Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg, you don\'t even care for the money, you just want to prove you can be a film-maker too, but that\'s not the point! Movies are something you should enjoy, and this... this is making bland jokes and pointless (as I may say ""comedy) with fart jokes and people being hit with objects... or just getting hurt (but you realize that they are okay)?Now please, STOP! You\'re ruining the name of ""parody"" and you are causing people to hate you even more!Please, as a warning, DO NOT WATCH THIS.', ""Never has a movie had a More Appropriate Title! Having seen the Scary Movie Series and many of the other works by this group of stars and Directors, my hopes for laughs were low...But even i could not have predicted how bad this really would be...Within the first 10 Minutes, we see possibly the WORST Amy Winehouse Look Alike EVER in one of the most UNFUNNY Movie Moments ever created... I was never a fan of Miss Winehouse, but dear god - How could anyone find this parody of her even remotely funny?It seems that the Directors have now reached a pinnacle since the first ideas they ever had... Scary Movie was Rude and Crude and Broke Barriers - It was funny...... Where this movie is like Epic Movie, Just plain CRUDE! So Crude that it is NOT FUNNY - END OF!I watched it simply because it was on the TV... I am damn glad I never saw it at the Cinema or wasted my money buying the DVD...There is an ART to doing PARODY... Being Crude is Great but only if you can do so with Intellect...These people need to take a step back and look at the works of the Wonderful Mel Brooks, Gene Wilder and many more... They may be old and their humour may not match the new generation, but they had a class that made it work and made it funny!Face it Fellas... You have no class... And trying to be crude when you have no class means you are just plain crude... And that means you FAIL!How would I rate this Movie? Sadly, We cannot do Minus ratings... So My honest view is I don't... Not even ONE STAR... But to submit my review I need to add one... And thats all it is getting!"", 'Disastrous OK, so ""Disastrous"" isn\'t an imaginative barb for this movie, but then there\'s not a shred of wit to the movie, so....I saw this movie for free. A friend who said he ""pissed his pants"" at the trailer had free passes. I think he\'s incontinent.A spoof of disaster movies might have been fun. This is not it. A couple disaster movies get referenced, not really spoofed. Instead, the ""spoofing"" is of recent movies of all genres, and of aspects of current pop-culture. Then again, how current is women\'s wrestling or the ""Head On"" commercials?If there\'s anything about it that\'s good, there\'s the 70 minute or so running time (where did they get 90 minutes?) and Nicole Parker seems like she might be good, if she had good material.', '""Really, Who Gives A F**k"" That\'s probably what the directors said when making this movie, though that should come as no surprise to anyone at this point. Once again Friedberg and Seltzer have teamed up to drive countless moviegoers to suicide with a new cinematic monstrosity the likes of which haven\'t been seen since The Garbage Pail Kids Movie.The acting is terrible. I have no idea who any of these actors are (I refuse to acknowledge Kim Kardashian as an actress after all the awful things SHE\'S put out) but pretty much any hope they\'ve ever had of a career was more or less destroyed by this movie. I\'m still baffled that Tim Curry managed to survive Scary Movie 2.The plot... There is no plot. There is no story. There is no CONFLICT. It\'s just a group of stupid kids going around ripping off every single movie made in recent years (at the time of its release) while tornadoes and other disasters strike the area.I wish a tornado had struck this movie during production...And remember how previous Seltzer and Friedberg movies had ""parodied"" genre films (if you\'re using the definition of someone who doesn\'t know what parody is)that they were named after? Of course not, seeing as like me you\'ve tried to pretend these movies never existed up to this point, but humor me on this. The title itself is a complete lie, holding no ties to the genre from which it takes its name other than being a complete disaster in and of itself.Consider this my review for ALL Seltzer and Friedberg movies: they\'re all a huge pile of cinematic fodder that should be cremated, buried and forgotten and their creators kicked out of Planet Earth.', 'Someone please kill Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer If nobody does, I will. After the critically panned Date Movie, Epic Movie, and Meet the Spartans, these two assholes decide to make another. It\'s the same formula, they make fun of popular movies in a tired, unfunny fashion.I saw it with a few friends, hoping maybe I could get maybe one or two laughs out of it (I didn\'t expect anything). When I came out, I was seriously stunned at how lame the movie was. One friend actually liked it, all I had to say was, ""What have you been smoking lately?"".I\'m not even going to bother explaining the plot, since there really isn\'t a plot at all. All I can say is, don\'t waste your money watching the film. It contains no genuinely funny humor and is one of the worst movies ever made. And everyone thought Meet the Spartans bad, wait until they get a load of this one.', 'Worst. Movie. Ever. First things first: disregard the rating above because they don\'t allow for rating low enough for this movie. I would honestly say 0 for real numbers although negative would be more appropriate since I left the theater feeling worse than when i entered.Next, I have to preface this by saying I only watched the first half of the movie. I\'ll also add that I have never walked out of a movie theater and i would have walked out far earlier if I were by myself. Luckily i saw it for free so those idiots who made it will get no profit from me.I presume that this movie is meant to be a comedy yet in 45 minutes i did not even chuckle at the movie. I laughed at my friend\'s face because it matched my own: ""Why are we subjecting ourselves to this?"" Crude humor can be funny, idiotic humor can be funny. Somehow Disaster Movie takes these kinds of humor to a lower level than I have ever seen. I have seen nearly all the other movies of this variety and they had some remote humor, this had none.I do not think hallucinogenic drugs could have salvaged this movie experience.I felt like someone should make a TV infomercial warning against these movies. Like the ones that tell kids not to smoke or say ""If you have mesothelioma you are entitled to monetary compensation, call this number for details."" If I had possessed the materials I would have made a shirt to warn people constantly about this.Please do not see this movie. Although if you know someone you need to get back at tell them to see this.', 'A Movie That Made Me Cry I normally don\'t cry in movies. Forrest Gump, Big Fish, Schindler\'s List, and many others have passed before my eyes, and not a tear has been shed. I consider myself a lover of cinema, with an appreciation for the art of film. I love many genres, including comedy, action, and of course, zombie movies. All of this aside, I watched ""Disaster Movie"" this afternoon, and it elicited one emotion from me: Anger.I have never been so irritated in all of my adult life by a movie. I have watched these cretins put out all of this filth that masquerades as ""entertainment"", and have held my tongue until now. I will say this right now: anyone who finds these movies entertaining should be ashamed of themselves. I generally believe that people can have whatever opinion they want, but people that actually like these movies are contributing to the downfall of the art form of cinema. By encouraging LionsGate to continue making these horrendous movies, all we are doing is perpetrating a cultural crime that we may never be able to fix. I grow weary of the multitudes who flock to theaters to see this garbage, and I weep for the future of our nation if this is what passes for entertainment these days.None of the jokes are funny. The parodies of films like ""Juno"" and ""10,000 BC"" fail to amuse, and even the lampooning of unexplainable culture phenomena like Hannah Montana and Amy Winehouse is an exercise in futility. No one has ever tried to do more with fecal matter and farm animals than this movie did, and it failed miserably.I beg all of you, as a lover of movies, not to see this film. It is an absolute atrocity, and I guarantee you will feel stupider for having watched it.PS: I work at a theater, so the only reason I even saw this movie was for job purposes. I didn\'t pay to see it, and neither should you.', 'So bad it sucks This movie was on TV once so I decided to watch it since I wouldn\'t have to pay any money for it.The main character Will (played by Matt Lanter) has a dream where he meets a stone age Amy Winehouse (I think it\'s supposed to be a joke) who tells him that the world is going to end the day this movie premiered in the cinema (Coincidence?) and to stop it they must find a crystal skull. Matt later wakes up to celebrate his super-sweet sixteenth birthday (despite him being in his twenties) in a scene where we get one unfunny joke and celebrity impersonation after another. Then disaster strikes (it seems kinda redundant though since this movie already is one), hurricanes, earthquakes, meteorites and other classic disaster movie ingredients hit planet earth one after another. Will, followed by his friends: Juney (Crista Flanagan), Calvin (Gary ""G Thang"" Johnson), and Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go out into the city and tries to find his girlfriend and a safe place and later realizes that he has to find the crystal skull to set things right.The problem with this movie is, just like other movies by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, that it doesn\'t stay on the theme but goes all over the place and try to spoof almost every popular movie that was made that year. And I use the term ""spoof"" lightly. Once again ""Seltzerberger"" show that they only grasp the most superficial concept of what humor is and never really bother to dig deeper and see what it is that makes things funny. Sometimes doing things outside the theme can work but not if it takes up a majority of the movie. And (for me) this movie is worse than Epic Movie. Yes you read right, Worse than Epic Movie. That movie at least had a story. Sure it was borrowed and ""crapified"" but at least it was a story. In this movie, everything that happens during the second act, when they try to find a safe place/figure out where they should go, just feels like a filler where the gang stumble into one reference after another. ""Seltzerberger\'s"" over-reliance on potty humor, movie/TV references, random musical numbers, deliberately obvious stunt-doubles and crappy special effects does not save them this time.Seltzer and Friedberg, your movie sucks horribly. If I may paraphrase a line from ""Billy Madison"" I\'d like to say: I award you only one star, and may God have mercy on your souls.Once again, if you want to see a GOOD movie made in the style that this train wreck was trying (and failing) to emulate, watch ""Hotshots"" ""Airplane!"", ""The naked gun"" movies, ""Top Secret"" instead.', 'Awful! Awful! Awful! This left me speechless......and not in a breath-taking ""Shawshank Redemption"" type way! I literally wanted to rip my arm off and throw it at the TV it was so bad. My husband and I made a bet with one another as to who could keep watching it the longest........the loser buying the weekend beers! I was quite happy to lose that night. I had no idea what was going on, it kept skipping from one sketch to another with no plot, no reason and NO POINT! Awful acting, awful impressions, awful film! Pretty much is what it says on the tin, A Disaster. Do not watch this movie. You\'d be better off stapling your genitals to a table for an hour...it\'ll be less painful for you!', ""This movie is a full crime. My friend said 'never watch this movie. It sucks it hurts your eyes and it's bad for your brain'. He said this movie was the second worst film he ever saw. Because of the fact that my friend watched like thousands of films, I was a little afraid to watch this movie. Unfortunately, My curiosity won my worries. After I decided to watch this movie, my friend told me about a hundred times not to watch this movie. But I was to curios. Then last Sunday while my friend was watching the Simpson, I watched this film. Before I start this review, let's go over some types of movies. The first one is a movie that's so good, you can hardly say anything after you watched it. Second: great, but not as good as the first one. Third: just good, forth: harmless, fifth: bad, sixth: very bad, seventh: a trash, and the last type: a movie that is used for torturing. This movie is used for the worst torture the humans has ever made.I should have listen to my friend. This movie was a total disaster. I should have known that when I saw the title. This movie starts with some not-funny slapstick and a Cristal skull.(Yeah I know it sounds familiar but let's just go through it). It's something about 'if you don't place the Cristal skull back in it's place then the world will come to an end'. Yeah really great plot. Let's give a medal for it. So anyway, this person name Will breaks up with his girlfriend and celebrates his sixteen year-old party....... even though he's not. Here, High School Musical comes out of nowhere and it's worst than the original. Think about it, worst version of high school musical. Than the story suddenly turns into save Will's girlfriend and Will meet's all kinds of characters. Here comes some great shocks like BATMAN IS FLEEING, CARRYING A SUITCASE. I am dead serious batman is fleeing, carrying a suitcase. Not satisfied? How about this? Ironman and Hulk gets defeated by a cow and so does Hellboy. Juno gets killed by Elvin and the chipmunks who are really monsters, Kung Fu Panda is a man wearing a mask, Hancok is some guy drinking, Giselle is eating glass bottles, and Indiana Jones is an old man who is really really short. There are some other characters but I don't want to talk about them right now. No don't cry yet, because there is one last thing: a song on the last scene. Which is a song that I like to call f**k song. I'm not giving this name because the song is bad. I'm giving this name because THE SONG IS ABOUT F**KING. I'm not lying. There is a song like this. This song is.........terribly horribly, horridly, disastrously, painfully, sickly, awful. I'll tell you this. Batman is playing the guitar. Okay? I repeat, Batman is playing the guitar.Maybe there is a bad movie that you should watch or maybe there is a movie that's so bad that it's funny. But this film is not one of those films it cannot be one of those films. My friend caught a cold right after he saw this movie and so have I. This movie is just.........awful. No, awful isn't the right word. There is not word in this whole universe that can describe this movie. Don't watch this it's bad for your brain, your eyes, your ears, your mind, and yourself."", 'Never EVER make a bet with your ""friends"" If you saw the other previous spoof movies by these two horrible gentlemen, then you should know that this already will be bad. I\'ll tell you the truth, if you want to watch it as a brainless person (ironically meant for the stereotypical teenagers, which I am not) then you will laugh at it a bit. But if you judge it, even a little, the movie automatically fails. Why? Never ask that when it comes to these two men.Remember the good old Hollywood days whenever making a movie was about showing people a type of art, and also a story that kept you on the edge of your seat? Well whenever word hit that making films earned you loads of cash, then all these greedy people came in the picture and its quite pathetic. These two are no exception. We still have movie artists (most notably the genius that is Christopher Nolan). But these two guys just...well I\'ve been writing so big words, let me put it in simple terms for these guys...These guys suck, they are not artists, but instead money craving whores. And their latest movie proves this even more so.The movie fails so easily its mind blowing. I mean nothing was funny in the trailer, and people usually put the best stuff in them (like idiots sometimes).I knew it was going to be bad, but I made a bet with my ""friends"" and that wasn\'t a good idea at all. I have to write movie reviews in a paper and tell everyone whats good and whats bad, same for my friends. We flipped on who has to review it...Why me? Well I\'m warning you at least. It shouldn\'t even be called a movie, nothing about it is artistic or original. The jokes..I\'m sorry, the references are made throughout at pretty much random, like the Hannah Montana or the Juno gig (they were actually close to spoofing it, but failed by referencing instead of joking and twisting it).Oh and please, the random wrestling scene? I don\'t know about you other guys, but I have high respect for women, and I have a high respect for film-making. What I do know is you shouldn\'t have something in a movie that doesn\'t add up to the story or anything. Nudity is not really needed (Titanic was the closest exception, but still you would\'ve gotten the idea if you only saw her bare legs.) Now I hate it when a girl says all guys are the same, perverts and brainless (and if you disagree with what I said about the nudity in a film, you might be one of them unless you actually believe it has a point), and sadly this film just makes that stereotype a little bigger. Thats if anyone watches it, which hahahaha!!! By the way, when I said movies should have scenes and only scenes that add up to the main plot, that was the ticket right there to say that this movie fails. Yup, just like that. Perhaps I\'m grading too hard for these guys. I mean its a brainless movie...Nope, they deserve it. Besides thats the best part about reviewing a bad movie, you get to rip it inside out. Thats if you know how to grade a movie correctly.But lastly (well I\'ve got about 4 scores worth of bad movies I need to write about, but whatever) the main idea about spoofing was brand new when Airplane! came out. Same with Naked Gun. And whenever something random came into play, the story was still progressing. For example, the arrow in Airplane! shooting out of nowhere: random, yes, but the story was still movie and no one was distracted except the audience. Perfect. Naked Gun, not only was it spoofing cop films and others, but it also had its own jokes. Same with Airplane! Anyways this movie was made for money, not to tell people a story. Simple as that, and never flip a dang coin to determine something that could be life threatening.I give it a 1 out of a 10. Just do yourself a favor and watch good movies, or mediocre for that matter.', ""100% Disaster !! Why i went to the midnight showing of this movie i don't know but i guess its better then buying a ticket to this movie. Honestly i cant say i have ever seen a movie as bad as this in my entire life. This movie makes gigli look like an OK movie. There isn't one funny moment in the entire movie it is basically all crappy acting mixed with crappy comedy. The only way you could possibly find this funny is if you are high or have an IQ lower then 30. Kim Kardashian and Carmen ELectra's acting is so atrocious i actually kind of felt sick while watching it. I mean you would be way better off watching KIm's sex tape cause at least its more entertaining then this movie. I highly advise everyone to not see this movie ever and try to get these to directors to never make another god awful movie again. Its kind of sad 2 grown men find this funny. PATHETIC"", ""It's been several months, and my review was inevitable...here goes... Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer.I'm generally a defender of the mainstream, but these two....these two....They embody all that's wrong with Hollywood, hell, with modern film in general. I hate when people defend them by saying they are satirizing films, they aren't satirizing films THEY ARE REFERENCING films, they are not a mockery of crappy Hollywood excess, they are an EXAMPLE of it. It's like if Michael Bay said his movies were meant to be a satire of excessive CGI and explosions. To do a parody or satire, you must PROVIDE or Impersonate examples of your topic and MOCK them over specific flaws and contradictions, you don't COPY them and change things by adding hip-hop dance sequences or having characters die randomly. It's clear they haven't even watched the films that are 'parodied' here, in fact, several of the films referenced were still being shot and in some cases only starting shooting, thus making effective parodies of those films impossible, and imagine for a moment if 'Hancock' or 'The Dark Knight' were never made and they still included references to those films, would you still consider that 'hip' and 'relevant'?.And even IF, pray tell, these films were funny, they are still off-topic. 99% of all the 'jokes' have nothing to do with Disaster Movies and those that do are so minor they are negligible. FACT: You cannot parody something effectively if you don't even mention it. Cut out the off-topic scenes from 'Disaster Movie' for example, and you'll only be left with 3, maybe 5 at the most, minutes of film, mostly credits. I don't care if it's the funniest film in the world, if it doesn't in some way deliver what it promises, I'm still not even gonna give it one star. If the titles were meant to be symbolic or something(like how 'Dancing with Wolves' isn't literally about dancing with wolves and Chris Ware's 'Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth' comic is about an adult with autism), it wouldn't matter, but in this case, they specifically say what they are going to do, and then disappoint. And sure a lot of comedies have off-topic jokes, but NOT ONES THAT TAKE UP 98.9% OF THE WHOLE FILM! At least 'Bio-Dome' actually took place in a Bio-Dome!So I apologize if you get off on being disappointed, sorry, but I'm not. I prefer to laugh when watching a comedy, or at least, have fun. And even worse, when they DO make actual parodies of something, they only do lame, obvious, predictable jokes even a small child could do just as effectively, if not more so. Oh, so Hannah Montanna's a merchandising whore, WOW I didn't know that!!! It's like some kid who tries to seem smart at the dinner table when his parent's are discussing politics by making political jokes, but who knows nothing about how politics work, so he just say's 'I'm a politician' and makes fart noises with his mouth. Is that cutting-edge and insightful satire? NO. But these idiots seem to think it is, because it's basically what they do, only with 'actors' doing it for them. My review for 'Caltiki' is a better example of satire. And don't call me a snob, because I'm a guy who loves stupid comedy, 'Jingle all the Way' and 'The Stupids' are some of my favorite guilty pleasures, hell, I started a thread about my favorite bad films a few months ago before some troll derailed it because I dared question the audacity of 'Mystery Science Theatre 3000' and was recently involved in a flame war with some loser who thinks 'South Park' is a sign of the coming Apocalypse.So don't blame other people's films, these are crap all on their own.And if they intend their films to be that way, that just makes it even worse, so they intend to make off-topic, unfunny, parody-devoid, boring, unpleasant films? That just confirms and justifies anything people say and do to them. Even assassination attempts. And if they really do consider their films to be real parodies, then they are one-trick ponies, and since plenty of comedians get grilled for doing a revolving door of the same few tricks,(like the Angry Video Game Nerd swearing too much and beating up guest stars, or Dane Cook being juvenile and unoriginal, although yeah, he is) then these two are the one trick-iest one trick ponies who ever lived, and their only trick is being off-topic.These films aren't even entertaining in a so bad it's good way, in fact, they are the antithesis of entertainment. I usually never listen to people who say they fell asleep watching a film, as I used to think that that was impossible and although I've done so, it was usually for a number of reasons such as being tired, drunk or forcibly on my own free will to escape a bad film. Well, it's true, these film are so boring they actually will put you to sleep like a lazy student in a cartoon. In fact, if someone could have filmed me 'watching' this garbage, I'm sure there would have been Z's floating over my head.Ditch this crap, please.Oh, and for all of you out there who are going to castigate me for paying to see this, I'll let you know I didn't pay a single cent to watch this festering canker sore of a film. ~ The previous review will suffice for your Freidberg-Seltzer film of choice~"", 'Who the hell says teens watch this? I wish this thing has a lower rating than one, this horrible excuse for a movie, deserves it over and over again. First off, these movies are NOT fueled by dumb teenagers foolish enough to watch them. I\'m 15 and even I know this is the biggest garbage ever. I don\'t watch these movies since Date Movie, because I learned right there that these movies suck. I went to a it with a friend and basically went to see how much it would suck. It sucked major ass. I walked out after a half-hour and hassled for my money back. When was the last time there even WAS a disaster movie? Juno, 10,000 B.C., Don\'t Mess With the Zohan, Indiana Jones, these are completely irrelevant, as are the hundreds of unfunny jokes ripped off the comedies they spoof (which is stupid as it is to spoof a comedy) and made them even less funny.Because of this movie, I will probably never watch MadTV again because it ruined my opinion of many of them. They give pathetic, poorly performed excuses for ""acting"", and showed how horrendously unfunny they can be. (It\'s worse than when Tina Fey left SNL).If you want comedy, don\'t watch this, spoofing is an art, a talent few posses, and these two jack-weeds don\'t posses it AT ALL. If you want to see good comedy, go to the store and buy Kentucky Fried Movie, Airplane!, Blazing Saddles, Spaceballs, Young Frankenstein, Scary Movie 3, and Superhero movie, because those movies are actually hilarious. Some less than others, but SM3 and SHM are far better than 10 Disaster Movies.So anyone who says that dumb adolescent teens fuel this garbage, think again because this stuff is garbage and I don\'t watch garbage. (this was an exception because people like my friend fuel this garbage :P.) This films will give you AIDS, makes you lose your hair, make you go blind, become flacid, makes you get a purple sock, this movie will destroy you and your sense of humor. Excuse the graphic descriptions, that\'s what it does to you, on the inside. DON\'T WATCH THIS MOVIE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. IF YOU DON\'T WATCH THIS, THOSE DUMBASSES WON\'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO FUND THIS GARBAGE. THINK OF YOUR FUTURES! WHAT IF 80 MORE OF THESE FILMS ARE MADE WHEN YOUR KIDS ARE AROUND. THINK OF YOUR CHILDREN, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DON\'T SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!', 'An honest comment from someone who has actually seen the movie Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the way everyone talks about these guys are as if they are on America\'s Most Wanted List, boy there is a lot of hate before the release date of Disaster Movie. They have brought us the ""stupid"" comedies like Date Movie, Epic Movie, and Meet the Spartans, pretty much all those movies have had the same hate, I can understand why. Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are like the kids in high school who just cruised by, just failing every class possible, being happy with the C\'s and D\'s, then they somehow get into Princeton because their parents had money or something, it\'s the exact same thing with movies. The way that I just happen to look at these movies is that they are like a MAD TV spoof, just mindless entertainment. I hated Date Movie, didn\'t mind Epic Movie, liked Meet the Spartans, Disaster Movie is a notch lower than Meet the Spartans. We have recycled jokes from the guy\'s previous movies, jokes that drag on and on to the point where you\'ll tear your hair out, and is of course, made badly.Will has had a dream that he feels like the end of the world is coming. All of a sudden the city is attacked Cloverfield style, he and his friends run around trying to find shelter and figure out what is going on while bumping into one celebrity after another. But even Batman, Iron Man, The Hulk, and Hancock can not save this world. Will and his friends realize that they have to save the world on their own and fight evil chipmunks, aliens, and flying cows.Disaster Movie, actually does have a couple laughs, I will admit that, I nearly died laughing during the Alvin and the Chipmunks parody, it was so badly funny, I just couldn\'t help but laugh. There are just some fun moments, I think it\'s ridicules that some people can not admit that. That\'s the reason for my title is because I saw a lot of comments from users that didn\'t even involve them seeing the movie, they were just complaining... this isn\'t the IMDb that I know, it\'s silly that people are just putting on comments that have nothing to do with their opinion on why they hate the movie before they even see it. Back onto the movie, my main thing that I\'m upset with, this movie didn\'t need a script, it seems as if Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer just made it up as they went along. For some reason we have movies that were literally just released last month like Wanted and Hancock, not to mention The Dark Knight. I think they just coursed their way through this, while the movie has some funny moments, my HONEST opinion, if you want to see this I suggest the rental, this is straight to DVD quality.1/10', ""Whoever gave this film the green light...should be arrested because he actually got the red light and thought it was green.See what happens when you democratize a medium and make it available to everyone. I mean, give someone a bunch of 35mm film stock, a Panavision camera and 25 million bucks, some hot chicks and dorky guys and they think that they can make a movie.Movies like this are good though!Because they can't get any worse! And set the Jerry Springer crap bar even lower.The plot is as thin as Kate Moss and the brain dead humor is lifeless even with real people saying the lines.Just think, 25 million dollars could have: saved some turtles, fed some people, provided shelter for others, helped Red Cross, built houses in New Orleans, kept in the bank to load out to people needing money, provided 25 good filmmakers with a million bucks each, kept Leslie Nelson alive for a few more years, and could provide a dollar each for some 25 million people."", 'Haven\'t we seen this sort of film 1479 times already?! And, it was funnier the other 1478 times. This film begins in 100001 BC and we see a caveman fall into a pile of Wooly Mammoth crap. Then, he\'s attacked by a guy who looks like he\'s from ""American Gladiators"" and then an Amy Winehouse look-a-like with fangs. Then he awakens and a Flavor Flav lookalike is in bed with him and his girlfriend in the present. Shortly after this, a dwarf exits the bed and gives the leading man the finger. While parody is supposed to be silly, these images are so random you wonder if the film was written or they just took darts and threw them at story ideas--all very, very fast and all which fell completely flat--and many of which were just very, very crude to hide that it wasn\'t funny. And this, in a nutshell, is what follows for the next 90 or so minutes--one supposed parody after another after another--none of which made me laugh.Here are my suggestions should they want to make another ""Disaster Movie"" or something like it:1. Less jokes and slow down so you have time to work out the parodies. Quantity is NOT better than quality. Yet, at other times, unfunny skits go on and on and on and on and they had neither quantity nor quality. The Hannah Montana and ""Enchanted"" bits were beaten like dead horses.2. Hire professional writers, not squirrels. I know they work cheap, but humor is NOT their forte.3. Jokes about performing abortions with coat hangers aren\'t funny. The film DID this and I am sure the entire theater when deadly silent. Like cancer and 9-11, this is NOT a good topic for comedy.4. Jokes involving dwarfs can work, but generally not. Unless you can get Mini-Me, don\'t bother.5. Find talented actors and people who really can do parodies. It would also help if they vaguely look like the subject of the parody. Some did, many did not (like Hannah Montana).6. ""I just s#%$ myself"" is not a particularly funny line. Avoid it.7. Same goes for ""suck on my placenta"". Not funny.8. Keep the ""Enchanted"" stuff--it\'s not great but compared to the rest of the film, it\'s gold. Just shorten it A LOT--this skit went on way too long and became 100% stupid. In fact, it was only funny for about 30 seconds.9. If you\'re gonna use a lot of actors from ""Mad TV"", try to get the more talented ones.10. No poop jokes. Poop is not comedy gold. Poop is just poop.11. No ""Kunk Fu Panda"". No.12. Get rid of Alvin and the Chipmunks unless you are willing to spend more than $13 for the puppets.13. Keep Beowulf--one of the only funny characters in the film who stayed funny throughout. He came late in the movie, though, and by then I am sure most of the patrons left the theater or killed themselves and never saw him.14. And, speaking of kill--kill the director, producers, writers and all the actors. I\'m not sure if this is legal, but I assume most judges and juries would allow this if they saw the film.', 'Please, burn this This movie falls into the very rare category of films that are an example of ""what NOT to do."" The plot is 100% muddled (makes no sense whatsoever). Try to imagine an episode of Family Guy with no plot, just one incomprehensible comedy clip after the other--that is Disaster Movie in a nutshell.The only question is ""Do you want the aspirin before or after you see this?"" Please take my advice and don\'t keep watching hoping it will get better -- it won\'t! Just save your brain cells for a night of binge drinking or heavy metal music. Damaging your brain on those will be less painful. I hope everyone who saw it in the theater walked out and demanded a refund.Yes, it\'s that bad...I can\'t even think of how to describe it...I just watched it and my head hurts so bad I have to cut this review short to get aspirin...later.', ""I can't believe I'm saying this, but this is even worse than Meet the Spartans The writing of this movie is truly inventive. Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have figured out how to make movies with no plots, based on movies they have only seen the trailers to, and these movies have such low budgets, that they still make money. Even with the low budget, they have an all star cast, full of bad Madtv actors, Carmen Electra and even the legendary Tony Cox. The acting, writing and direction all sparkle like the latrines of a diarrhea filled bathroom. This movie might be on par with Schindler's List for the amount of laughs, or there lack of. Honestly, though, this movie is one of the most god awful things ever made. Even their last all time low Meet the Spartans was topped in terms of horrible writing and direction, and the current rating of a 1.3 shows that Mr. Friedberg, Mr. Seltzer and their other writing partner Satan can't get much worse.Disaster Movie...what a title for this, considering not one Disaster Movie is spoofed. Every movie here is one that came out within the last year, many which came out after this piece of garbage was written, and not one of them was a disaster movie. I guess they did a parody of Twister with the cow falling, but being the geniuses these two gems of writers are, they probably haven't seen Twister and just thought it would be funny to have a cow crush Iron Man. I was practically wetting my pants with some of this material. The Hulk's pants fall off, then he's hit by a cow. Duh, haha, duh, that's some good stuff. I think the target audience of this movie must be two year old mentally unstable children, and even they would find the humor a bit too dumb and immature.Onto the plot of this winner. Will (Matt Lanter) has a dream that he's in 10,001 B.C. and he fights the Wolf from American Galdiators and meets Amy Winehouse who burps for like ten minutes on him, then gives him the Crystal Skull. He wakes up to find his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo) is leaving him for Flava Flave and little man Jojo. He throws a super duper sweet sixteen, despite that he is 25, and then a High School Musical number goes on, and then Calvin (played by the wonderful G. Thang) tries to curve a bullet, then Carmen Electra gets in a battle with other beauty Kimberly Kardashian, then Junie sings, and then later Javier Bardem, Prince Caspian, Hellboy, Batman, Beowulf and a police officer are all played by Ike Barinholtz, and thousands of sub-plots and movie spoofs of every recent movie comes in.I must admit, I laughed more here than in Meet the Spartans. Meet the Spartans produced about .5 chuckles, where this in total produced maybe 1 chuckle out of stupidity. The laughs were obviously infrequent, considering there was only 1 in this 75 minute collage of badly reproduced movies. The acting is actually not too bad in comparison to Meet the Spartans or Epic Movie, but the overall enjoyment level of none was reduced to less than none. It's sad movies like this could be made (let alone be called movies). This was the most awful putrid flick to ever appear on the big screen, and as long as it makes money, each year we will be treated to even worse movies from these swell writers and directors.Overall, this was not the best movie around, in fact, it was the worst. Avoid this at all costs. If it was a choice between this movie and death, it would be a tough choice.My rating: BOMB out of ****. 75 mins. PG-13 for stupid humor and poopoo mouth."", ""Not worth the admission Went to see it with a friend at the spur of the moment. I haven't seen the other movies of this kind besides the first two Scary Movies. We ended up being the two oldest people in the theater (21 and 22). While the masses of preteens behind us laughed hysterically at the minute long belch session, I was exchanging horrified glances with my friend. It was pretty terrible. If you took a bunch of 6th graders together and told them to put together a skit in about 5 minutes, it would probably look something like Disaster Movie. The only moment we laughed was the chipmunk scene. Seeing them head-banging just seemed hilarious at the time, maybe because everything else leading up to it had been so mind-numbingly terrible. It's not worth the price of admission. The was one good thing about the movie though. The night felt so anti-climactic after that film, that we decided to go to Atlantic City and had a blast."", ""Don't even bother... I just finished viewing Disaster movie on opening night. I came in with no expectations at all due to being tired of these spoof movies since Meet the Spartans, but I had to go in since I couldn't see Death Race. So when I was viewing this movie I really thought nothing could make me laugh. There were no character developments, there were no disaster movies spoofs(the only disaster things happening in the movie were meteors falling which were only 2 by the way). To tell you all the truth, I only chuckled once or twice(at the Juno parts). The rest of the jokes were either dumb, immature, or just recycled garbage from past movies.So to tell you all right now I have to say one thing about this movie: Don't see it, it's no improvement from previous spoof mistakes.Rating: 1 out of 10"", 'This Is Not The Worst Movie Of 2008. This Is The Worst Movie Ever. ""Disaster Movie"" is the 4th movie that has been made by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. Like ""Date Movie"", ""Epic Movie"", and ""Meet the Spartans"", this spoofs many blockbuster movies and pop culture figures of recent years. This time, the focus is on the ""disaster"" theme similar to ""The Day After Tomorrow"".Since 2006, Jason and Aaron, who first met while working on ""Scary Movie"", usually release one movie every year. This is actually the second movie they released this year.This is actually the second movie they released this year. At the beginning of this year in January, they did ""Meet the Spartans"", which opened at #1 and spoofed the entire script of ""300"". I saw that film and thought that it was going to be the worst movie of the year.After seeing this one, I can say ""Disaster Movie"" is quite possibly the worst movie ever. I mean, it really is the worst movie ever made and released. You can put it straight to DVD or Blu-ray, and it still wouldn\'t be funny. You can air it as a made-for-TV movie, and it still wouldn\'t be funny. You can make it into a TV show pilot, and it still wouldn\'t get picked up. You can even get ""MAD TV"" canceled by including this as one of their skits.What throws the whole movie is that the jokes are continuous every 4 seconds and never have any humor. Every time you think they will forget something, they end up spoofing it. They actually try to spoof every movie made this year. And they even try to include every TV character and celebrity in their jokes. It just doesn\'t amuse, and it just doesn\'t quit. They really have no idea of when to quit.But the real reason why the jokes aren\'t funny is that it\'s inaccurate, overused, and butchered poorly. They spoof ""High School Musical"" with the main characters, and they poorly spoof Gabriella as a cheerleader, which she never was. They spoof ""Kung Fu Panda"", an animated movie, using a robot panda that looks like a panda in the real world. The performance they did with ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" will give you so many nightmares, you would rather the 2007 version over this movie. The idea to use a male actor to play Carrie Bradshaw in the ""Sex & The City"" spoof is too desperate, too obvious, and worst of all, so wrong. And the other jokes used have been used already in their other movies, used already in other spoof movies, and are too old to even try and would have been used at the appropriate time.This movie doesn\'t even spoof disaster films in general, unless if you can find any real ""Cloverfield"" spoofs. Some of the spoofs aren\'t actually in the movie and rather used as promotional ads. All they try to do is give many films and A-list Hollywood stars the roasting they ""deserve"". In reality, they destroy the ""parody film"" genre again and with more damage that a lot of people would rather stop making fun of them in movies like this. Normally, you can actually expect a film parody to be declared the worst movie ever by many people. But I guarantee that there is not and will not ever be a movie as worse as this one.', 'This movie actually made me angry... Angry, in as so much as that I wasted my money, my time, and my intelligence. I could actually feel my brain cells die off while watching this atrocity. I would say that no one over the age of 11 should be let into this ""movie"", but that would be an insult to 11 year olds. Don\'t bother to read for a synopsis, given that you would first need a plot in order to have a synopsis. Indeed, I think I have already put more thought and effort into writing this comment than those who wrote the movie put into the script; that\'s assuming there even WAS a script.I would give 0 stars, but I can only choose 1 as the lowest. Save your money... save your time... save YOURSELVES!!! Avoid this movie at all costs, and boycott anything else put out by these shameful ""creators.""', 'Yes.... a disaster. Watched on TV with my easy to entertain teen sons. After 15 min\'s they say: What a TOTAL piece of CRAP! For gods sake change the channel before we puke! Can we go rent a movie that\'s actually funny? Pleeaase..Sure this is a movie for kids, but what happened to all good comedy\'s? Those comedy\'s that demanded some brains?My 9 year old son just can\'t see any fun in people who is just acting stupid or clumsy, falling, etc. But he really enjoys movies like Fargo (not the series). Fargo is hilarious if you have some brains.Why can\'t i just make a short statement? ""Have to be 10 lines..."". Sorry, but not everyone likes to babble...', ""Rubbish This movie was absolutely awful, I didn't laugh once while watching this tripe. It was full of the usual lame duck jokes, clichés and bad hammy acting.A bunch of teens with a camcorder could probably do better than Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltze. How they managed to get the green light on this project is beyond me.Don't waste your time watching this movie, pick something more worthwhile to watch instead, or else go outside and enjoy nature.Just do something else-anything, besides wasting away 88 minutes of your life watching this garbage."", 'How to make a parody without jokes Whenever someone doesn\'t like a movie, a common go-to criticism to hurl at it is that it has no plot. In reality, this is usually a load of crap. A movie can have a plot you don\'t like, or it can have a plot that\'s a bit contrived, but pretty much every movie has a plot. This brings us to ""Disaster Movie"". This movie has no plot! I mean, there sorta kinda are four main characters, but they\'re basically just mannequins who stand there while unfunny things happen around them. The order of the scenes honestly doesn\'t matter at all, this is almost like a sketch movie but without the punchlines. I\'m not a big fan of writing classes (read my reviews for further proof), but what ever happened to the classic story structure where protagonists have to reach some kind of goal while fighting some kind of adversity? Have I just gotten too old-fashioned for the movies, is this the kind of experimental filmmaking that will become a standard for further generations? Well, as of this writing this movie\'s got a whopping 1.9 rating, so I think I\'m safe. Got to admit though, I did laugh once during the otherwise terrible ""Sex and The City""-spoof. Sue me, I probably deserve it.', 'Worst ever I have had root canal surgeries that were more fun. This mess makes ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" (long considered the worst movie ever made) look like an Academy Award contender. The basic idea is good, make fun of all the disaster movies, but the actual movie is horrible. I get the feeling that the makers got high on something and just threw whatever came to mind into the script, figuring the audience would be too dumb to understand. These people should be banned from ever making another film and kept away from all movie cameras. I managed to sit through a total of 15 minutes and felt like I should wash my eyes and brain out with bleach to get rid of the memory. Terrible doesn\'t begin to describe it.', ""'Ronseal. Does exactly what is says on the tin.' 'Disatser Movie. Does exactly what is says in the title!' This is without doubt a contender for the worst movie in cinematic history - past, present and future!The humour is painfully unfunny and can be interpreted as offensive on occasions. There is nothing wrong with offensive humour (well there is), if it's rather humorous, just ask Sacha Baron Cohen - however this is unquestionably offensive to any human with an average intellect.Jason Friedberg I actually admire for evolving the 'horror spoof' with his fine comedy 'Scary Movie', which occasionally had me in stitches. This however, borders on the lines of disgracefulness.Matt Lanter prancing around for the entire duration with woeful lines and abysmal acting may appeal to the less intellectual women who need to keep there eyes occupied for approximately an hour and a half. However, everyone else will be left feeling mugged, either for the fact they have wasted their precious lives on this drivel, or - even worse - they have spent good money on this drivel.I think my verdict is loud and clear!"", ""I laughed at how ironic the title is more than anything else. I might have only sat through only half of the film, but from that I came to the decision that I didn't want to watch anymore. It's not funny in the slightest. In fact, I laughed at how ironic the title is more than anything else. Whoever gave this the green-light should be sacked immediately. I do have a couple of the films in which this tries to parody and fails miserable, like Iron Man and the Incredible Hulk, and all I can say is that it completely destroys them - it actually made me angry. This is truly a Disaster Movie. This film made me cringe with all the incredible badness of it all. I will never watch this film all the way through. However when I do, I want an award."", 'This aptly named movie is the worst film of 2008, the worst film of the 2000-2009 decade and possibly the worst film since the birth of motion pictures... Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer should be ashamed of themselves. Completely and utterly.I\'m an extremely easy guy to please, especially when it comes to movies. I\'m the one guy in the room who will admit to having enjoyed ""Pluto Nash"" and ""The Mummy 3."" I\'m the guy who will try to find something in every film to like. I enjoy movies, and am very rarely disappointed in them.Except for films like this, which are complete and utter idiotic failures by every stretch of the imagination. The team of Friedberg and Seltzer, whom are responsible for this abomination, should be ashamed. They have fundamentally failed understanding or displaying even the most basic ideas of filmmaking and comedy. They have failed with this film in a way which I have never before witnessed. This movie has literally made me angry in the few times I tried to sit through it, it was so insulting.How can they release such complete and utter trash like this? I actually cannot comprehend how they could have so little respect for the audience that this filth would be released.OK, fine, I\'ll write an actual review. But this film ain\'t pretty.This film has no plot. Literally no plot. It revolves around a group of people fleeing various disasters, while encountering a random array of pop-culture figures (including Batman, Amy Whinehouse, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, Princess Giselle from ""Enchanted"", Iron Man, Hellboy, Flava Flav, Juno from ""Juno"", etc.) who show up without any hint of irony or humor, introduce themselves to the camera, then awkwardly leave after a failed attempt or two at humor. Eventually they encounter a dwarf that is supposed to be Indiana Jones (played by Tony Cox) who tells them that in order to stop the disasters, they have to return a Crystal Skull to an altar. That\'s it. That\'s the plot.The acting is atrocious all around. The main actors are completely unlikable and their characters are made into incredible jerks. (We\'re supposed to root for our hero to get back his girlfriend even though she\'s some sort of serial cheater, and the main character is the single most bland, undeveloped person you could ever encounter.) The celebrity look alikes don\'t resemble the celebrities they are ""parodying"" in the least and make no attempt to sound or act like them. (Nicole Parker is the only one to come vaguely close as the parody of Princess Giselle from ""Enchanted"", but it still fails and is ruined by a random joke that destroys the character completely) You may notice I put ""parodying"" in quotes above. This is because, by definition, this film fails to serve as parody even though it\'s meant to be. Parody is by definition meant to comment upon or mock established original works through humor and satire. This film doesn\'t do that, the characters merely show up without making any sort of comment on the original works, and are too unfunny to mock them, hence, this fails at becoming parody, hence, it isn\'t parody, and Seltzer/Friedberg failed at making what they set out to.The production is among the worst I\'ve seen. The direction is stale and uninspired to the point of frustration for the viewer. The special effects are some of the worst I\'ve ever seen. I\'ve seen YouTube clips made by 12-year-olds with high production values than this. Costume and set design is painfully bad. The editing is abysmal and destroys a lot of the jokes, the animatronics are just crap. This is one of the worst productions I\'ve ever seen.And the humor makes no sense. Every joke in this movie falls flat as a pancake. Jokes have no set-up, no humor, no irony and no payoff. It\'s just random quips and nonsensical pop-culture references that date the film horribly.I really just an thrown a loop as to how Seltzer/Friendberg can live with themselves knowing they make films like this. This is by far their worst film, but all of their other films are nearly this bad as well. It\'s honestly upsetting. They have no respect for audiences, no respect for their actors, and no creativity.This is without a doubt the worst film of 2008. It\'s without a doubt the worst film of the 2000-20009 decade. And it is possibly the worst film since the birth of cinema. This makes films like ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"" and ""Space Mutiny"" look like high art. Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, you should be ashamed. 1 out of 10.', ""Excruciatingly unfunny There have been several different movies that I've seen in my life that were so painfully awful I was sure there would be no other to be worse, I have sat through movies like Alone in the Dark, Battlefield earth, North, and this piece of shi* trying to pass itself off as a comedy is unquestionably the absolute worst thing I've ever seen.Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are the most talentless hacks ever to pick up a video camera or use a keyboard. My head felt like it was going to explode after I finished watching because it enraged me so much.Here is a small list of things this movie tries to parody, and somebody needs to explain to me what any of them have to do with the disaster genre.Juno, American Gladiators, Mylie Cyrus, Flavor Flav, Amy Winehouse, Jessica Simpson, and lots others that I feel should have sued the hell out of these assholes for including them in this vomitorium of a film.This plot makes absolutely NO SENSE AT ALL! It consists entirely of jokes so awful that it'll make you sick having to hear them. At one point they accuse Juno of having bad writing, the hypocrisy and Irony was big enough to see from space.I don't want to continue thinking too much about the horrible experience I had viewing this wretch, so I will end by saying this is no doubt the worst movie ever made in history and If you laugh at ANYTHING in this heap you are an idiot and a waste of life, plain and simple."", ""I'd rather be tortured than watch this again! Undoubtedly the worst movie I have ever had the misfortune of watching in my life!This film, and I use the term loosely, was so awful that it is one of only a handful I have ever switched off in order to be bored instead- as being bored is preferable to having your eyes gouged out by this dreadful piece of garbage. The story is non existent, even to the extent of parody, and the parody itself is done abysmaly with virtually no reference to the source material at all. In fact, this film is almost entirely made up of 'parody' versions of clips from other films that were only taken from the trailers from said movies- the vast majority of which aren't disaster movies in the first place. How this is supposed to pass for a comedy film when it has no plot, virtually no parody and fewer jokes than the most dirgeful funeral I have attended is beyond me. Perhaps that is the joke? If so, it's not funny.Whilst the rest of the genre made by (some of) the same production team such as Date Movie and Superhero Movie at least made parodical reference and jokes based upon films from the genre the relevant film was named after, Disaster Movie instead is just a description of what the end product turned out to be. We can but hope that this film puts nails in the coffin of the directors careers so they can go and be more productive in the film industry sweeping floors or emptying bins- footage of which would be more entertaining than this drivel.Mark my words- no matter how bored you are, how cheap this becomes on disk or how free it may be on the internet- do not waste your time watching it. You will only regret the loss of those precious minutes of your life, which could have been spent more satisfyingly and less painfully by watching paint dry whilst being beaten about the head with a mallet.Forced watching of this film should be added to the bans under the Geneva Convention as torture. I for one would rather be water-boarded than see this film again. You have been warned!"", 'Awful I must say first of all, that I did not expect this to be a very good movie, or even all that funny, just a few laughs. What I got, was a complete lack of humor. Not a single joke made me laugh say but two where I mildly smiled. First of all, this barely had anything to do with as disaster happening, except for a few earthquakes now and then. Most of the movie consists of 1. throwing in as many references from other movies as possible, in context to absolutely nothing and 2. abysmal rap numbers every 5-10 minutes, that just made me want to bash my head in with a hammer. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this piece of crap.', 'Disaster (of a) Movie Remember the good old days when Mel Brooks did ""Young Frankenstein"" or David Zucker did ""Airplane?"" This movie will have you wishing you were watching those movies. Seltzer and Friedling don\'t do movies; they create really bad sketch scenes strung together without a plot, usually embarrassing their actors along the way. It\'s not funny at all, nothing has a point and at no moment does anything come close to making sense. It\'s like watching the thoughts of the stars of MADTv under marijuana overdose. There are no jokes, not a decent impression and one scene is dragged on one after another. It\'s basically twenty to fifty characters running into each other in search of a plot. Nicole Parker acts as if she\'s on acid, Crista Flanagan looks wasted and the rest of the cast look embarrassed they agreed to do this. It\'s almost as if they\'re looking at each other wondering ""Was this in the script you read?"" or ""When do we start the movie?"" or ""I hope this isn\'t used in the final draft."" Bottom line: Seltzer and Friedling need to be stopped from doing these movies. I could do it better. Anyone could do it better.', 'Rusty Nails.... Yes, the title of this review is relevant. Because said instruments for bonding wood which have largely changed into iron oxide are what I wanted to shove into my eyeballs after watching this... No. I refuse to call this a movie.

Starting with the (Highly Appropriate, but not in the way they intended) title. Disaster Movie, huh?

Suffice to say, humor is the wrong word; I\'d call it ""something that a failing-grades immature twelve-year-old who thinks toilet jokes are the pinnacle of all humor might laugh at"" and even that might be a stretch. The jokes aren\'t funny at all, the random scenes don\'t fit in whatsoever, and they\'re not even parodying their targets, just making references and effectively saying ""See how stupid these movies are?

For a spoof film to have no satirical content and just have footage of superheroes flying into walls and various other stupidity. And what the hell is up with the Juno and sex in the city bit? That is without a doubt the weirdest bit in movie history do you really think the woman who wrote Juno is going to see her characters baby kick a woman in the face and go, oh I got burned. Also what's with the bikini girls running away from meteors? That's just kind of sexist.The plot is ridiculously thin it's just people avoiding meteors.

I wanted to leave almost 5 times during the movies. The actors were horrible. I could play better roles handicapped and blind.This is the worst movie I have ever seen.

This year Jason and Aaron pull out another ""movie"" from their repertoire of steamy crap, and I quoted movie because this thing is barely a movie. When I think of a movie I think of something that has a plot and characters, but this is some kind of unknown piece of work. A razzie won\'t do this film justice. But at least the razzie people now know who to give the award to. So bad it almost makes the other ones seem good.PROS:I have nothing good to say about this film. Absolutely nothing. CONS: my favorite part of this comment. The cons. OK first of all Aaron and Jason need to look up the definition of spoof in the dictionary, the definition might vary from a dictionary to another, but I am pretty sure no dictionary will give the following definition, a piece of work in which various objects fall on pop culture icons and random stuff with no synchronized manner happens. If a dictionary gives that definition to the word spoof then i stand corrected. For me parody movies are taking a little amount of a pop culture reference and expanding upon it and making original jokes such as airplane and scary movie and all those other movies which Aaron and Jason should have learned from. In this film, however, the genre diverts from a parody to wackness.99% of the jokes in this movie are prolonged and at some point you feel like you are being tortured. And then the unbearable redundancy. As if the audience like the jokes they already made in the film, they make other ones in the same manner. Where one of three things happens, something falling on someone, or somebody being hit brutally and somehow make it through, or somebody starting a random dance-off. The scene I hated the most, not that I liked any, is the scene where the chipmunks from Alvin and the chipmunks show up, and for some reason start chewing on Juno\'s character(named Juney). The scene was somewhat disturbing and rubbish. everything in this film is a rip off. 95% of the characters are ripped off. the jokes are all rip-offs and it almost looked like an unscripted reality show, you know, where people do random stuff cause it\'s not scripted.FINAL THOUGHTS: The saddest part is that these guys are making a living like this, I mean come on, there are talented actors and directors out there who are dying for roles and these guys are making a living by writing a script that looked like it took two hours or less to complete? unbelievable.Another thing, What is wrong with us human beings these days? I mean some people were actually laughing hysterically during the film, and I thought of the film Idiocracy, where people find this kind of stuff funny. I look forward to hating the next movie they are going to bring. I really do.', 'Poor horrendous!!! I didn\'t laugh once during the entire movie. Save yourself 80 minutes! Give it a miss. Sadly I have to make up 10 lines about this movie. The movie does not deserve 10 lines but here we go anyway. I watched the superhero movie and that was funny, this was just not even worth a chuckle. I found this movie disjointed and it just basically struggled. I would be interested to know if anyone found it remotely funny. I gave it a 1, but it should be minus 10. I first saw the unbelievably hot Vanessa Minnillo in the TV show ""True Beauty"" and thought that she was pretty good in that. It is hard to believe that she went from the host of a TV reality show giving a good performance and then blew her credibility out the window by actually agreeing to participate in this garbage. I knew that this movie was going to blow by the four minute mark but I persisted with it hoping that it would get better or I would get a chuckle every now and then - but no - FAIL!!! The most ironic part of my day was that i watched a movie called Harpies - and that was worse! I think I have pi**ed Karma off, and I don\'t know what I have done wrong!! ha ha ha', 'Why.....? I had been almost certain that this was going to be better than ""Meet the Spartans"" but after I watched this, I actually thought about watching Meet the Spartans again. This movie was an EPIC fail! I don\'t know what gives people the idea that we actually want MORE of these types of movies. They all pretty much fail. Scary Movie was entertaining but once they had made things such as Date Movie and Epic Movie, It all began to suck! I read though other comments and I saw a majority of people agreeing that this movie blows! I would NEVER even think about THINKING to recommend this movie to another person. Even taking the time to look at the back of the DVD case would be a waste of time! In conclusion of my review, I recommend that NO ONE picks up this movie. I don\'t think even an 8 year-old could find any enjoyment of this film. ***DON\'T WATCH IT!***', 'Abysmal It was...I mean...I just don\'t know what I can say. Anyone with a soul knows this ""thing"" is worthless.If you like things you know getting hit by other things you may or may not know. Popular culture references that are often not even that timely. And production quality that is on par with community college theater. If all of that stuff is what makes a movie good for you, still, STILL, don\'t watch this. Because it fails at failure.And a word to people who are into bad movie self-punishment. Just rent Troll 2, no one but the renter makes any money. And it doesn\'t give a false positive that someone watched this on purpose.', ""Oversaturated and corny. It seems that this type of movie died after the Wayans brothers stopped making the Scary Movies. Those movies were funny and didn't try to squash 20 movies in that didn't fit or relate. Scary Movie 1 was about Scream and Scary movie 2 was about House on Hunted Hill. These other movies could have been good if done right but these ( Date Movie, Epic Movie, Meet The Spartans, Superhero Movie, and Disaster Movie ) were poorly executed, lazy, poorly written, and off topic.Distaster Movie could have been good if base off and idea in the genre like Twister,Cloverfield, or Day After Tomarrow. Also if it actually had funny and talented actors and writers.This movie only had one moment that made me laugh out loud just because I wasn't expecting it. That one moment was very brief as it was followed by Chucky Cheese like animatronic Chipmunks that ruined my one moment of joy in this cluster f of pop culture regurgitation that had no business being in the movie.I can't believe I paid to see this crap! After the movie I felt embarrassed and cheated.""]"	"The movie opens with spoofing ""Armageddon"" and ""10,000 B.C.""
In the year 10,001 B.C., a caveman Will (Matt Lanter) runs away from a mammoth before getting in a fight with Wolf (Ike Barinholtz). He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse (Nicole Parker), who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008 (which was the film's opening day and Michael Jackson's 50th birthday), revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull ""Indiana Jones"". The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will apparently dreamed all of this. He then finds out that his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), is having an affair with Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) and the two break up with Will not admitting his true feelings for her.Later that day, Will has a ""Sweet Sixteen"" party at his house, despite the fact that he's 25. Among the guests are Juney (Crista Flanagan) spoof of ""Juno"" and Will's best friend Calvin (Gary ""G-Thang"" Johnson), who attempts to curve a bullet around the room ""Wanted"" to stop Seth and McLover ""Superbad"" (Noah Harpster and Austin Scott) from stealing the alcohol, accidentally killing ""Dr. Phil"" (John Di Domenico), Anton Chigurh (Barinholtz), and the Beautiful Assassin (Carmen Electra) in the process. By then, Amy arrives with her new boyfriend, an underwear model (Nick Steele), before the ""High School Musical"" number is performed with cameos by an off-key Jessica Simpson (Parker) and Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal).However, the party comes to a halt when the lights go out as the room shakes and a bulletin on the radio claims that it is the end of the world. Will, Juney, Calvin and his girlfriend Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go outside during a meteor shower and find that ""Hannah Montana"" (Flanagan) has been crushed by a meteor and, even when caught between life and death, is still promoting her merchandise until her wig falls off, revealing her as Miley Cyrus before she finally dies. While this occurred, a kid (Ty Wesley) wakes up ""Hancock"" (Walter Harris) and mouths at him to go save the world, only to be knocked away as Hancock tries to flee the city but hits his head on a streetlight and knocks himself out. Soon after, the city starts to freeze over, and the group retreats to a garage for shelter. They meet the ""Sex and the City"" girls, who claim to have first grabs and Juney beats a drag queen version of Carrie Bradshaw (Jason Boegh) for the garage ""Don't Mess With The Zohan"". After discussing global warming, Calvin says that he is cold and suggests they take their clothes off. Only the girls take their clothes off, and the guys stare in awe until Juney's water broke.Later, Will has a dream where he is a ""Jumper"" and accidentally impales himself on Prince Caspian's (Barinholtz) sword (Caspian identifies him as ""the guy who ruined Star Wars""; also a reference to Matt Lanter's voice role as Anakin Skywalker in the 2008 CGI Clone Wars television series). After Will's dream ended and he was chided for not even trying to commit to his relationship, the gang leaves the garage and Will gets a call from Amy, admitting his feelings for her before he decides to get to her as Lisa gets killed by a meteor. While the others comfort a distraught Calvin, the ""Enchanted"" Princess climbs out of a manhole and gets hit by a taxi, with Calvin catching her as they immediately fall in love with each other. Juney guesses she's a princess thrown out of her kingdom by an evil witch, the Princess explains that she's a ""demented homeless chick who lives in the sewers"" due to consuming ""lots and lots and lots of mind-altering, enchanting drugs!"" After getting into a dance off with the Princess's Princely pimp dancing to Sizzle C's 'I Like Them Girls', the heroes flee when a tornado appears with ""Iron Man"" (Gerrard Fachinni), ""Hellboy"" (Barinholtz), and the ""Incredible Hulk"" (Roland Kickinger) attempting to fight the natural disaster and being knocked down by its projectile cows. When they find shelter, Calvin gets a call on his shoe phone from Lisa's mother, who is informed about Lisa's death and how Calvin has found someone hotter than Lisa. Afterward, they encounter a group of cute singing chipmunks ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" who suddenly turn rabid, attacking the gang and eating Juney's flesh until she presumably dies. The chipmunks go after the others until Calvin and Will trap them in a trash can, suffocating them as they attempt to break free.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she's trapped under a statue, they run into ""The Dark Night"" (Barinholtz), who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it's closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills ""Speed Racer"" (Jared Eddo) so they can hijack his car with Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson) in the trunk along with Chim-Chim and Spritle, and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will's dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive ""Night at the Museum"", including ""Kung Fu Panda"" (Yoshio Iizuka), who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing ""his"" wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into ""Beowulf"" (Barinholtz), who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will's father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by ""The Love Guru"" Shitka (John Di Domenico). Then all the characters come sing a song about dating each other which sets of a chain ""Disaster Movie F**k Song"" ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow."

2	8.5	"['Unlike anything ever done in the history of cinema This movie is the beginning of the culmination of Marvel\'s masterfully woven cinematic universe. Beginning back in 2008 with iron man, we are finally seeing the results of all the movies have been pointing to; and it did not disappoint. Thanos is a complex villain, with deeper and more interesting desires than just ""world domination."" The dilemmas all the characters face in this movie (both the heroes and the villains) are truly thought provoking and leave you on the edge of your seat. No other set of movies has beeen so involved, so expanded, and encompassed so many story lines/characters and previous movies. The sheer amount of star power alone in this film is insane; and they do a masterful job of weaving all these unique and various characters into a common storyline.', 'This movie will blow your mind and break your heart - and make you desperate to go back for more. Brave, brilliant and better than it has any right to be. Over the past decade, Marvel has earned itself the benefit of the doubt. The studio has consistently delivered smart, funny, brave films that both embrace and transcend their comic-book origins. The 18 blockbuster movies produced since Iron Man first blasted off into the stratosphere in 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films as a genre - they\'ve helped to legitimise it. Indeed, Marvel\'s two most recent films - Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther - have received the kind of accolades usually reserved for edgy arthouse flicks. And yet, it\'s perfectly reasonable to be apprehensive about Avengers: Infinity War. This is a blockbuster film that\'s been ten years in the making, its plot hinted at and scattered throughout 18 other movies. It features 30 or so characters, each with their own complex backstories and motivations. And all of them are coming together in a bid to stop a giant purple alien dude from destroying the universe. It sounds ridiculous, and feels impossible. But that\'s precisely what makes the final product such a monumental achievement. Masterfully directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, Infinity War is bold, brainy filmmaking at its very best: the kind that will lift your spirits, blow your mind and shatter your soul - occasionally in the same scene. It demonstrates on an epic scale what Marvel has known all along: that special effects and tightly choreographed action are there to serve the story. For all its blockbuster spectacle (and there\'s almost too much of that), the film works because it\'s anchored by the heart, humour and humanity of its characters.The film\'s basic plot is simple: Thanos (played via motion-capture by Josh Brolin), intergalactic purveyor of death and destruction, has long been on the hunt for the six Infinity Stones that will give him complete control over the elemental building blocks of the universe. He dispatches his acolytes to Earth to retrieve the Time Stone, currently in the possession of Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and carve the Mind Stone out of the forehead of Vision (Paul Bettany). It\'s a literal existential threat so terrifying that all the heroes we\'ve come to know and love - from the Avengers to the Guardians of the Galaxy - must put aside their differences and unite against a common foe. From the outset, it\'s immediately clear that neither the film\'s directors nor screenwriters (Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) are interested in playing it safe. Most other superhero films are bled of high stakes - the hero in the title might suffer untold trauma, but it\'s a super-safe bet that he or she will make it to the end alive. There\'s no such guarantee here. Within the first ten minutes, we are confronted with the dark, twisted depths to which Thanos and his acolytes in the Black Order will sink in order to achieve their goals. Death, as well as genuine loss and sacrifice, is intrinsic to the narrative drumbeat that drives Infinity War ever forward, and the film is all the better for it. That\'s not to say the movie is a morbid and depressing experience. What\'s so impressive about Infinity War is how it expertly juggles its constantly shifting tones and moods. When it\'s funny (and it very often is), it\'s deeply, truly funny. The film finds maximum joy in flinging characters together with merry abandon, mixing and matching ones you\'d never have expected to share scenes or trade banter. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is floored by Thor\'s (Chris Hemsworth) godly muscles. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is charmed by the wit and intelligence of Shuri (Letitia Wright). And it\'d be impossible to not be utterly delighted by Peter Dinklage\'s inspired cameo. It\'s a blithely tongue-in-cheek sensibility shared by Marvel\'s best comic books, which understand that humour can make you care when it really counts.And, boy, does Infinity War make it count. There are many heartbreakingly human moments threaded throughout the film: from the charming surrogate father-son dynamic shared by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Peter Parker (Tom Holland), to the undeniable love that ties Vision and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) together. In many ways, the film stands as a testament to the human capacity not just to love, but to love fiercely and beyond all logic. It\'s right there when the unfailingly noble Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) declares, ""We don\'t trade lives"", even when giving up one could save billions. There\'s even a chilling echo of it in Thanos himself. A lesser film would have turned Thanos into a one-dimensional villain, much the way he\'s all monster and maniac in the comic books. In Infinity War, however, Thanos\' end goal is surprisingly relevant when it comes to thinking and talking about the staggeringly overpopulated world in which we live today. There is, as it turns out, method to Thanos\' madness. It makes the tragic twists and turns in his relationships with his estranged adopted daughters, Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Nebula (Karen Gillan), all the more unsettling. For the most part, Infinity War does justice, too, to the many heroes who have been assembled for the film. The Russo brothers displayed great skill at interweaving multiple perspectives and character trajectories in Captain America: Civil War, and they do so again here, with twice as many characters. Even the most minor of supporting players, like Don Cheadle\'s James Rhodes/War Machine, are given story beats that land. It helps that Marvel has always taken care to cast genuinely good actors in roles that might otherwise come off as silly and slight. Even so, there are a few standouts amongst this enormous and enormously talented cast. Emotionally speaking, this is Downey\'s film. He plays every note of Tony\'s reluctant courage and bone-deep trauma, as he embarks on what he\'s convinced is a suicide mission. He\'s ably matched by Cumberbatch, who finds vulnerability even in his character\'s most cunning and calculative move. Hemsworth, meanwhile, is given free rein to import the big-hearted comedic swagger of Thor: Ragnarok into this film - while also layering it with a deeply-felt, jagged grief for the losses he has suffered at the hands of Thanos and the universe.In a film with so many moving parts, some elements don\'t work quite as well. A couple of characters that you might have expected to be right at the forefront - including an original Avenger or two - fade into the background. The film tumbles from dizzying fight scene to dizzying fight scene, and while most of them are fantastically choreographed, there are some purely dumb moments that literally revolve around attempts to prevent Thanos from clenching his fist. In effect, this is a superhero mêlée that\'s part over-the-top and part overkill, and might prove too much for those who don\'t already care for this franchise and the characters in it.Minor quibbles aside, though, Infinity War is yet another step in the right direction for Marvel. It continues the studio\'s tradition of placing a premium on rich, complex storytelling that respects both its characters and its audiences. But it also refuses to make things easy for itself. The film ends even more bravely than it began, with a final ten minutes that will haunt and horrify you in equal measure. It\'s a stroke of bold, brilliant genius - a narrative risk so audacious that you\'ll want to follow Marvel wherever it goes next.', 'A Summer Film That IS Even Better Than The Hype Summer movies often hype themselves as spectacular events not to be missed and their ad campaigns use words like ""epic"", ""spectacle"", and ""smash"" as ways to build the hype to increase advanced box office sales.\nThe summer 2018 film season kicks off in a big way with ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and it is the rare summer film that exceeds is lofty expectations and delivers a crowning achievement for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\nWhen Thanos (Josh Brolin), embarks on a deadly campaign to find and possess the Infinity Stones, he leaves a path of death and destruction in his path. When his pursuit leading him to Earth, Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), who enlist a reluctant Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), to the cause just as the minions of Thanos arrive.\nWith The Avengers fractured and scattered following the events of ""Captain America: Civil War"" the teams find themselves dealing with the threat in various groups as fate steps in to divide many key members of the team. This allows for a great entry by the Guardians of the Galaxy and allows the film to take a very enjoyable path. Essentially the movie weaves separate storylines into one cohesive and very satisfying epic. You have a story with the Guardians as well as one with many of the key Avengers, as well as others with characters old and new. As such it is like a Guardians, Avengers, and Marvel film all rolled into one and each one supports the other very well yet has the charm and identity you would expect. While the tone is very dark as you would expect with literally half of the known universe facing destruction, there is also some solid humor in the film that never once undermines the story or pacing.\nNaturally the effects are stunning as you would expect as Marvel has put a significant amount of money into the film and it shows in every eye-popping action sequence.\nWhat really impressed me the most was that the Russo Brothers never let the FX of the film overshadow the characters and with a very large cast, it was nice to see everyone got their moment and you did not see members of the cast trying to one up each other.\nThere are some real surprise moments along the way and the action is easily the best of any Marvel film to date. Many fans had expressed disappointment with ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" for me this film is significantly better than the prior film and is everything that a Marvel fan would want in a film.\nI was also surprised by how well Thanos was portrayed as while you hopefully will not agree with his deductions and methods; you could actually understand his motivations and it help him transcend from the usual megalomaniacs which are so common in films of his type. I am really looking forward to seeing what comes next and make sure you stay through the credits for a bonus scene.\nBelieve the hype, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an epic not to be missed and is an example of what a summer event film should be.\n5 stars out of 5', ""Excellent Film I was amazed to see so many negative reviews; so many people are impossible to please. This movie was 2 1/2 hours long, but I could have sat there another 2 1/2 hours and not noticed. Thoroughly entertaining, and I love how the directors weren't afraid to take chances. I've read a lot of other user reviews that claim that there's no plot. Unless you're mentally handicapped or not paying attention because you're on your phone the entire movie, the plot is pretty clear, and decent in my opinion."", 'Epic conclusion to Marvel\'s first 10 years I absolutely loved this movie. It was intense, action-packed and emotional. Also delivering comedy when needed, but it was a relatively dark film. All of the actors delivered great performances and the characters continue to be fleshed out and be made human despite the fact that they\'re superheroes. This is easily the best superhero movie ever made. Thanos is one of the best villains of the MCU, as well as one of the best of Cinematic history in general. Upon first viewing, I hated him, but found his character intriguing. Similar to Emperor Palpatine in the Original and Prequel trilogies of Star Wars. The more times I rewatch it though, I start to understand Thanos\' point of view more and more. The blurred lines with his motivations make the movie more compelling. Even driving some people to say that Thanos was right in all this. I wouldn\'t go that far, but I would say his character is misunderstood. Definitely a compelling villain in Thanos. The ending of the movie was insanely emotional, but I love how they (mainly) set aside the original Avengers team to take on Thanos in the fourth Avengers movie. I, for one, cannot wait.That eerie ""Thanos will return"" at the end of the film sent a chill down my spine. It truly is the end game now, and I can\'t wait to see the Avengers rise up and likely defeat Thanos in the next movie.+Every Hero has their moment to shine (Much like the villain wants, the movie achieves balance in this way)\n+Good Comedic moments to balance (again pun intended) the dark tone of the film\n+Emotional and Heavy ending (Seeing Earths Mightiest fail is something devastating to watch)\n+Complete hype moments that reward you for being a fan of this franchise for 10 years\n+Incredible performances\n+Phenomenal original score \nEtc. Not much you can find that\'s wrong with this movie. It\'s literally the perfect movie Marvel has been building up to for 10 years. And those that claim it didn\'t have an ending as a negative, I beg to differ. Just because the villain won doesn\'t mean it didn\'t have an ending. My Rating: 10/10', ""The amount of people that don't understand the movie is astonishing All the reviews that say this movie has no plot are either trolls, idiots, or didn't are to take the time to watch previous marvel movies. Every single one of those ratings and reviews should be taken down and not added to the rating for Infinity War because of their fundamental lack of understanding. It's like coming in and watching the last 2 minutes of an hour long drama show and saying this episode sucks because it has no plot. It's utterly ridiculous!There have been 31 marvel movies leading up to this point. All 31 has have some plot that leads to infinity war. Infinity War IS the end game movie. There is nothing left to explain, nothing left to discuss, it is all-out fight for control of the most powerful items in existence, the infinity stones. There have been 31 movies to explain in someway the power of these stones and/or the heroes that come together to fight Thanos in this movie. It's like a long game of chess where Thanos finally makes his move, and it's a huge one.So I beg of any of you who reads this. Don't listen to anyone who says this movie has no plot, has no reason and is only fighting. They aren't worth listening to, Infinity Wars has roughly 60 hours of plot from 31 precious movies leading up to this monumental fight for life or death, and the movie is done to near perfection. The movie is glorious, the CGI is fantastic, the battles are awe-inspiring, and Thanos is made worth of your fear from the very beginning. He is truly the Mad Titan that captures your heart and crushes it right in front of your eyes. Anyone who doesn't think this clearly didn't see the same movie."", ""Avengers: Infinity War, the best movie since LOTR!! I'm almost wordless, and.....LOTR is my no.1 movie of all-time, and Avengers: Infinity War is another LOTR to me, still I love LOTR better, but it's just because LOTR filled with great motivational messages, this is the only difference, put aside this IW = LOTR, or maybe even better than LOTR. Hat off... Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War"", ""Again a fight, but bigger I went and looked, and I want to express my thoughts.I went to this film with very high expectations, with a sense of something. I went to him twice, the first time, myself, and the second with the family, and I was even surprised that my mother, sister and dad (who do not understand this movie at all) brought unreal pleasure and an ocean of emotions.Each frame, each scene does not let you get bored, from the Marvel logo, and to the stage after the credits. Favorite heroes once again experienced side by side and you feel it, you are completely absorbed in a hurricane of events and you are watching it in one breath. In comparison with the War of Infinity, even the Confrontation looks like an ordinary fight in the sandbox.Uuuu, and the villain, the best as for me the best in this kirovoveselennoy, he is not just a bot at once, without motivation, no, it's just the opposite. I liked Thanos so much that you do not want to, and he began to impress me, in terms of his convictions (I had it only once, with Joker Heath Ledger). He has feelings, he makes choices, he's alive.Tense scenes are beautiful, in one moment I still let off a meager male tear (and this happens to me very, very rarely). What about the humor, the jokes are correct for me, and they do not bother you like Thor: Ragnarok, although in the beginning they look a little tight. Well, the action, it is very high-quality, and in comparison with the Black Panther is generally ideal.And of course the film can not be without punctures. The lack of predictability of some story lines, and a couple of moments that were very predictable, but they are fade against the background of all this scale.Yes, you will not find anything in this film about something, something, but, what, what, what, steep humor. Thanks to Marvel and of course the Rousseau brothers, the beautiful actors and the wonderful movie that I've been waiting for for 3 years.Out of 10, I give the War of Infinity 9."", ""THE BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER!! Engrossing, Epic, Emotional. Those are the three E's that define this movie. The latest instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise is at its very best, culminating ten years of marvel adventure and spectacle with the biggest and most boldest movie in the superhero genre. \nSo let's start with Anthony and Joe Russo, the geniuses that made this beast of a movie. After announcing that they will be directing the next two Avengers movies, Marvel fans knew at once that this will be the darkest Avengers movie yet. Yes, it was very dark with more of a serious tone. More than Winter Soldier and Civil War (previous marvel movies directed by the Russo Bothers) combined but they also had what the other Avengers movies had as well, the humour and it was not at all tasteless. Nobody really cared if it was necessary or not because the humour worked along with the edgy parts of the movie. This is by far the Russo brothers best work among the Marvel movies completely raising the bar of superhero movies to it's highest. Praise to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for writing the amazing script (they also wrote the scripts of Captain America, The Avengers, Winter Soldier, Age of Ultron and Civil War also known to be the best marvel movies). \nNow, the characters and story. Practically everyone that you've seen in the previous marvel movies that aren't dead, are in this movie. Everyone had the chance to shine even if it's the smallest way possible. There were so many character arcs in this movie and none of them were cut short or boring. Every scene is in the movie was worth digesting and deciphering, along with the surprises and the twists and turns that will get audiences on the edge of their seat. Everything from character development to the pacing of the storyline, makes you jump, scream, gasp or cry. \nAnd of course, the one and only, Thanos. The villain that has been teased one too many times is finally here and he delivers. Josh Brolin officially portrays the best villain in the MCU, completely pissing on Marvel's villain problem. He brings all out on the table with everything he's got. Not only will you hate Thanos by the end of the movie, but you will understand him and maybe even feel sorry for him for a few seconds. They brought layers into him that no one has seen in a movie portrayal of a Marvel villain. They made him scary and strong at the same time vulnerable and understandable. The motivation of his doing and his character development made him the best character in the movie, making the movie all about him. \nI cannot tell you anymore about this movie because then I would be spoiling. All I have to say is that whether you're a marvel fan or not, and if you at least know what has been going on in the previous marvel movies, GO AND WATCH IT. It will not be a waste of your time or money. Digest this to prepare for what's to come. I may be bias once again but I just have to. I have to rate this movie 10/10. If I don't, I would be betraying myself."", 'Great popcorn film, surprises the series with fresh takes Well, Well, Well....I was so ready to tear this down - 19th MCU film, too many stars, bloated CGI, first of a two parter, and so on and so on...Yet, this is so much fun. Pure popcorn...now in the dictionary under ""popcorn film"" is just the poster for this film. Somehow, the Russo Brothers have juggled all the parts to give everyone some time in the sun. They are helped immensely by two things: the premise is so pure Mcguffin that you just watch Thanos look for Infinity Stones which gives a primal momentum and that the film\'s stars/characters are looking to move on - that means, actual stakes for once as people could really die and not just comic book dying either.The DC people must be kicking themselves. The lightness and comedic touches are brilliant. You are laughing out loud, comedy level, but at totally organic character humour. It means you are so entertained throughout its rather long running time.The other big surprise is Thanos himself. Normally, I hate CGI characters but somehow they have made Thanos and Josh Brolin work enough to give the character an actual arc. This is one of the better MCU villains and I never thought I would write that.The stakes are real, the charisma levels are amazing, it is like ""Oceans 28"" and I can\'t wait for the sequel...that says an enormous amount considering the challenges this film faced.', 'Everything we could\'ve hoped for Oh. My. God. What an incredible film! I\'ve never done a review of a movie before, I\'ve only done TV shows. So bare with me, I\'m gonna discuss the major points and chuck in a theory or two. But to start off...Wow. This film could be the best Marvel movie ever! But I will give it a few days to digest and probably a second viewing before deciding on that. It absolutely lived up to the 10 year build up since Iron Man 1, how far we\'ve come in a quick 10 years is remarkable. The Thanos character absolutely hit the mark. He was menacing, intimidating, vicious and so much more. Props to the actor who played him. Thanos\' plan succeeds (for the time being) and we get a whole lot of ""death"" because of it. In this movie there was death, and ""death"". The former refers to characters such as Loki, Vision and Gamora. We saw these characters die and there bodies be left behind. For this movie not to lose credibility, these characters, in my opinion, must remain dead. Now ""death"" refers to what we saw at the end, Thanos, with all infinity stones, clicked his fingers and half of humanity, including half of the avengers (important to note that all the original avengers are still alive) dissolved into dust giving the impression of death. I expect these characters to come back at some point during the next Avengers film, most likely due to the originals saving them. My final theory regards Doctor Strange. On the ship with Stark and Spidey, Strange said that if it came to it he would save his stone over Stark and Spidey\'s lives. However, in the end we see Strange give up the stone to Thanos on the condition Stark stay alive. My prediction is that when Strange saw all the possible futures, the only future in which they win must heavily rely on Tony Stark. Which makes sense, Tony started it all so he should finish it. Incredible film, can\'t wait for the next one to see how it all resolves. 9.8/10', ""Overrated and bloated This movie was an underwhelming, chaotic blend of several different movies. I'm going to break down several of the different elements of the movie and why they either worked or really did not work. I'll start with the villain:Thanos, as a whole, is a pretty good villain. He is intimidating and the movie gave him a good script. The problem is that his powers are so freakin inconsistent. Guardians of the Galaxy already established just how powerful infinity stones are, but Infinity War seems to forget that. In the battle on Titan, Iron Man and about five others are able to hold Thanos down and nearly get his gauntlet off. At this point, Thanos has four infinity stones. Sorry, but there is no way they could restrain him at that point.  Infinity War also includes four other villains which the directors apparently felt had no need for an introduction. Collectively, they are called the Black Order (or dark order) and their names are never said so, I'll give them nicknames. There is Noseless the Terrible(who is terrible), Avatar Lady with Horns (also terrible), Rock Dude (basically Korg but bigger with a goatee), and Guy with Pointy Axe. The only people who understand who the heck these characters are, are Marvel comic fans. The biggest problem with Infinity War is the character developments and inconsistencies. I'll describe the worst cases:Star-Lord: When the first Guardians of the Galaxy came out, Star-Lord was a great character. Infinity War completely ruins him. He turns into a jealous jerk and an actual idiot. There are brief flashes of the old Star-Lord but mostly he is just a character that you despise. At one point during the battle on Titan (Thanos's home planet), Iron Man, Doctor Strange, and the Guardians of the Galaxy have Thanos held down and they nearly remove his gauntlet (which makes no sense in the first place because at this point Thanos has four feakin infinity stones). As they are removing the glove from Thanos's hand, Star-Lord finds out that Thanos killed Gamora earlier in the movie. \nStar-Lord then starts punching him and this wakes him up from Mantis's mind powers and this time he demolishes them before going on to destroy half the galaxy. Vision: The development of Vision is also really, really bad. In Age of Ultron he is strong enough to wield Thor's hammer but in Infinity War, he has developed and updated to the point that he never wins a single fight against anyone because it fits the plot. Thor: So in Thor: Ragnarok it was established that Thor is the god of thunder and doesn't need a hammer to be powerful. Then in Infinity War they completely forget this and make him get tossed around like a ragdoll. In fact, he never even uses his lightning abilities until he forges his new weapon. Did the directors forget about what got established in Ragnarok or did they just make Thor weak because once again it fits the plot and Marvel can get away with whatever the heck they want?Scarlet Witch: Wow! Her character was inconsistent. One minute she is getting demolished by some dark order member and the next she is holding off Thanos (who has five infinity stones at this point) for an extended period of time. Once again her powers are only as powerful as the directors need them to be for any given scene. Hulk: So apparently the Hulk is now scared to come out? Ahh, poor little guy. This is a terrible plot twist and really doesn't make much sense. Another thing that did not work about this movie was the sheer amount of characters. I was worried that it might be too many and it was. As a result, there were too many different subplots going on and they couldn't even have one final battle. They had to have two climactic battles going on at one time and the result was a bloated mass of CGI filled action for the last forty-five minutes of the movie. Now, I'll discuss the action in the movie by rating each of the major battles with a brief description:New York battle: 2/10 This battle was absolutely terrible. Noseless the Terrible comes in with the Rock Dude and tears up the city to take Doctor Strange away and nothing about the action is even slightly thrilling. The action in Alicia Vikander's Tomb Raider was better than the action in this battle.Wakanda battle: 8/10 This battle was actually pretty thrilling with great background music and some really cool action. The first half of this battle is a lot better than the second though. It also gets annoying because it's only fed to you in short segments while flashing back to the battle on Titan or Thor forging his hammer-axe-thingy. Overall though, this battle was good and part of the reason that I give Infinity War a 6 and not something much lower.Battle on Titan: 6/10 While, there is some good action in this battle, there are also a ton of inconsistencies revolving around Thanos and how powerful he is. Overall, I wasn't super impressed.I also need to discuss Thanos's plan for a second. He wants to wipe out half of the universe's population because the universe is overcrowded. Then he can finally rest. Did he think of the fact that the universe will repopulate again and all his hard work will be for nothing? I definitely prefer a storyline that involves the threat of total destruction of earth. Finally, I am going to discuss the characters that are killed in the movie and why it makes Avengers 4 really predictable. So at the end of the movie, Thanos snaps his fingers with all the infinity stones and half of the universe is killed. Somehow by random selection, all the original avengers survive. The odds of that happening are 1 in 64 assuming Hawkeye survived the dreaded finger snap of Thanos or 1 in 32 if he died while having his epic gaming session with friends (guess he got bored of the whole avengers thing). The characters that die are almost all new characters like Black Panther, Spiderman, Doctor Strange, etc. Several of these characters already have planned sequels so we know they are going to come back when the original Avengers find a way to time travel and reverse everything. It's just too predictable.Overall, Infinity War was not a very good movie. I do not understand the hype. It was choppy, inconsistent, overcrowded and overall just not the great movie it's cracked up to be. I would not recommend going to the theater for this one. I left feeling exhausted and tired of the MCU."", 'An objective review of Avengers: Infinity War I don\'t mean to be negative here, but Avengers: Infinity War\'s 8.9 on IMDb is entirely undeserved. Marvel superfan or not, this movie has nothing on films like The Dark Night, La La Land, Pulp Fiction, or Inception, all films which it either outranks based on it\'s 8.9 rating or comes close to. I get that there was an insane amount of hype around this film, and it\'s awesome to see our favorite Marvel characters come together (The Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor, Spiderman, Captain America, Black Panther, etc.), but we shouldn\'t let our excitement over all of our favorite characters coming together cloud the fact that ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an overly long movie that relies on cheap, unbelievable deaths to generate excitement and that isn\'t particularly well written or edited. I commend the directors and writers on being able to successfully interweave so many stories, but the movie just felt too long. It\'s fight scene after fight scene, and while the performances are good and the script is pretty funny, the film isn\'t really original and its only redeeming factor is that it\'s full of characters we all know and love. It\'s funny to see Thor poke fun at the Guardians of the Galaxy and to see Iron Man and Spiderman interact with Doctor Strange, but when we look at the film objectively, it\'s really just a standard superhero film (with more superheroes than normal) that relies on cheap plot twists to generate excitement and emotion. No matter how much we love Marvel, we all know that there\'s no way any of the characters who ""died"" are actually going to die. The filmmakers expect us to believe that Black Panther (who just made Marvel over one billion dollars), Spiderman, and the Guardians of the Galaxy have all met the end of their respective stories, even when there are publicly announced sequels for all three franchises. I hate to say it, but all the character deaths at the end are just there for shock value, and it\'s cheap. From a technical perspective, the fight scenes are directed well, but that\'s about it. The editing isn\'t particularly great and the film feels too long at 2 hours and 40 minutes. I feel like half of the time spent hopping from planet to planet could have been cut and the movie would have been about as good if not better. OVERALL: ""Avengers: Infinity War"" could have been amazing, but it\'s too long and relies on cheap deaths to generate hype. This film is not deserving of it\'s 8.9 rating on IMDb. I think that Captain America: Civil War was a *much* better movie.6.5 out of 10.', ""Don't believe sad DC fanboys bad reviews. There is literally no way to dislike this movie. People complain about humor. Use your brains and you will see that the humor is necessary yet high quality. There are no mistakes in any of the aspects of the movie.

This is literrally the hardest movie ever in cinema history. And they succeeded amazingly. Which Zack Snyder/DC couldnt do with that terrible movie Batman V Superman. Only 2 or 3 main characters.

If you are anything like me you will definitely feel a sense of ""everything is gonna be alright"" because of the generous sprinkling of light humour that makes the situation feel less serious than it actually is. The emotional roller coaster that begins right at the beginning of the movie to the very end has you feeling more and more frustrated and on edge as it goes on. Don\'t get me wrong this movie is absolutely stunning and amazing and a cliffhanger at the end has you wanting more and more. I\'m definitely very excited to see how this storyline will carry out in the next Avengers movie.', 'Best to date This is by far the best Marvel film since the winter soldier.', ""ABOVE MY EXPECTATION.

One of the best part of it the team up Guardian & Avengers just amazing, full of humor cannot stop laughing watching their scene together. For 1st time my brain cannot process what going to happen in Avengers 4 really hype about it.Really worth watching it , if u non Marvel fans or superheroes fan this movie is worth to watch , really enjoy it .

Every Marvel Fan needs to watch the movie as words cannot describe the magnificience of the movie.', 'Absolute Perfection - Exceeds All Expectations and Blows You Away. Best Marvel Film Yet. TL;DRA phenomenal achievement - 10 years of films leading up to this has been worth itSimple story allowing so much to be packed inInfinity Stones are more than just dull McGuffinsA wildly different story and structure to most superhero filmsStructure more like a Game of Thrones episode - this works to its benefitThe ending is bold and brave - a real strength of the film as a wholeAll characters are fantastic - their interaction is the greatest joy of the movieNo one character hogs the film - everyone gets their fair share of screen-timeThanos is the greatest Marvel villain so farAbsolutely hilarious and very quotableSublime, varied and non-stop action that never feels like too muchSets up Avengers 4 very wellThe greatest Marvel film yet--------------------------------------------------------------Wow. Just wow. For a film that generates so much hype in the months running up to its release, it\'s incredible when it not only meets expectations, but exceeds them to the point where even more hype is garnered. There are so many words to describe Marvel\'s latest - emotional, epic, fun, stressful, scary, hilarious, incredible. In about 2 and a half hours you will laugh, you will cry and you will cheer. It\'s a phenomenal achievement, the biggest marvel of Marvel yet, and a huge round of applause is warranted to everyone involved in the film. You don\'t need to be a fan to love this film.It\'s a very simple story without lots of twists and turns, making it very easy to follow - that is, provided you\'ve seen all (or at least most) of the films so far. For those who have been at least casually following this monumental cinematic series, everything will make sense and the characters are already known. By letting the previous films set everything up, that allows Infinity War to pack so much more in the film and just get on with it from the word \'go\'. The ever-important Infinity Stones themselves are much more than simple McGuffins - the film makes the audience care about them, Thanos visibly becoming stronger with every one he collects. It\'s not just as simple as Thanos collecting six stones, however. Instead this doesn\'t follow the usual superhero story or structure, instead being utterly unpredictable, allowing the audience no respite or way to prepare for the madness that occurs. This is a very different type of superhero film, Marvel able to break away from the mould. This is a strength of the film and they absolutely do not shy away from it. This is best seen in the ending which will go down in history, along with the likes of The Italian Job. It\'s a bold, brave finale - in a way I would have preferred a slightly more rounded end, but the film is too daring for that, instead setting things up for Avengers 4 perfectly (even in the post-credits scene).Considering there are over 30 characters the audience will recognise, the directors and writers have done an excellent job of balancing the characters, all seen through the structure of the film itself. Structured more like an episode of Game of Thrones, we follow different groups of characters as the climax slowly comes to a head. One moment we\'ll be with Iron Man, Dr Strange and Spider-Man, the next we\'re journeying across the galaxy with Thor and the Guardians, and next we find ourselves with Cap, Falcon and Black Widow. No character seems particularly side-lined or unimportant and the structure allows for each and every character to make a solid contribution and get their fair share of screen-time.Whereas Age of Ultron had more of an emphasis on story rather than characters, Infinity War is the complete opposite, the characters coming together instead being the main point of the film itself. It\'s a relief then that, besides all characters having a fair amount of time, they are all fantastic and an absolute joy to see all together in one film, every group seeping excellent chemistry. It never feels forced or gimmicky, but instead authentic and natural to see them all team up and work together. It also emphasises how perfectly cast all the characters have been over the years, able to hold their own and interact with everyone else so brilliantly. With so many characters, a film like this shouldn\'t work, but incredibly it does and is all the better for it. None of the groups are ever the default boring one (unlike Frodo and Sam in Lord of the Rings), but they are all lovable characters with exciting plot lines. On top of that they\'re all hilarious. As ever, Drax might be the funniest; but there are jokes from Stark, Strange, Quill, Groot, Rogers, Okoye... the list is endless. In a film with so much heart and action, it\'s amazing they managed to fit in so much comedy. It\'s beginning to sound like a cliché, but this is absolutely the funniest Marvel film yet - certainly funnier than the majority of ""comedies"" that come out these days. Even the new character Eitri played by Game of Thrones\' Peter Dinklage gets his share of laughs. The biggest surprise with regards to characters however is Thanos. While his cohort may be formidable yet fairly bland (with the exception of the brutally sinister and downright scary Ebony Maw, played by Tom Vaughan-Lawlor), Infinity War\'s central villain Thanos is an exceptional antagonist, brilliantly played by Josh Brolin. As terrifying and intimidating as the monstrous purple alien may be, there is a quiet, emotional side to him. Unlike many villains, he\'s not looking for power for the sake of power. There\'s an element of humanity to him and he genuinely believes that what he\'s doing is for the good of the universe. This is not an antagonist to add to the ever-growing annals of forgettable villains - Thanos is the formidable foe we needed and wanted. No longer will Loki be the best Marvel bad guy by default. Will he go down as the best superhero villain since the Joker?Of course it\'s not all laughs and chasing stones. As expected in a film like this there\'s action - lots of action. It\'s appropriate that the word \'war\' appears in the title since this is by far the most action-packed Marvel film we\'ve seen. Despite the nigh-on non-stop action, it never gets boring or seems like too much. With a rich plethora of characters comes a wide variety of action and fighting styles. No two characters fight in the same way and so the action always seems fresh. It\'s a pleasure seeing all these characters we have grown to love come together and fight with one another. The CGI and fight choreographing is incredible and the battle scenes are beautifully filmed. Definitely worthwhile being seen in IMAX!The biggest downside is having to wait a year to find out what happens next, with no clues in the upcoming Ant-Man and the Wasp or Captain Marvel in the interim (since they\'re set before the events of this film). Still, if the next Avengers film is anything like Infinity War we\'re in for another incredible treat. With terrific character interaction, hilarious comedy, sublime action and a shocking ending that will keep you awake at night - it\'s all perfect. The 10 years Marvel has spent leading up to this has been absolutely worth it. A splendid and monumental achievement. All hail Marvel - but beware, Thanos will return...', 'Mind blowing.. Just neglect the so called reviews.Its personal views and differs from person to person.Make your own review and keep it to yourself.', ""A celebration of ten wonderful years of entertainment and overall fun Avengers: Infinity War is the seventh film in Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the nineteenth film overall. Directed by The Russo Brothers (Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War), it is truly a terrific film of its kind and a near-perfect culmination of everything the cinematic universe has been building up to for ten years.Two years after the events of Captain America: Civil War, the Avengers team remain a fractured group of heroes, with some completely dropping off the radar altogether. However, one day, the powerful intergalactic tyrant Thanos (Josh Brolin) arrives on Earth to complete his collection of Infinity Stones, which upon acquiring all six, will allow him to control half of the known universe. With time quickly running out, The Avengers must reunite and team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy to put an end to Thanos' unquenchable thirst for power.Avengers: Infinity War is more than a typical MCU superhero film. It is a celebration of ten wonderful years of entertainment and overall fun. While the film does struggle with some tonal shifts during the first act, its brilliant action scenes and clever dialogue more than make up for these shortcomings. The film's ending will be overwhelming to some and most likely will divide fans over how it is executed. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo do a superb job developing Thanos' personality outside of simply wanting universal domination. His motivations feel somewhat morally ambiguous and at times even make him seem sympathetic. Despite the film's darker tone, there are still some hilarious scenes of banter among the heroes, particularly between Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Steven Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch). As is the tradition, be sure to stay after the credits for one bonus scene.I rate it a solid 9/10"", ""Dark Knight version of MCU Remember it's fast, does not have time for crap scenes, everyone is lucky to get a line.\nHard to catch on for non MCU guys but I gotta say Awesome."", ""Do not believe the ratings, this movie is not nearly as good as people claim it is In the end this movie proved to be an absolute slugfest that never stops. The action is nonstop and there is neither any buildup or climax to the action. This could have been redeemed if the actors had any time to do their jobs but they were never given any time to perform and so the characters are rather disconnected from their surroundings and their reactions ridiculous. The only character that is given time to evolve in this movie is Thanos, and he is an interesting figure and I fully approve of how they chose to adapt his motivations instead of following the comic books. But one character is not enough and as usual there is nothing on the line which is hardly surprising since they need to milk every cent they can out of the franchise, and I do not in any way blame them for this. But when the movie ends and not a single character have been killed except for heimdal I really can't bother with their cash grabbing ways any longer. For the people who actually believes that half the characters died i pity your stupidity, because it is painfully obvious that they will be revived in the next movie and everything will continue. \n \nThe day marvel decide to actually have the heroes sacrifice crap and take responsibility for their actions is the day I will respect marvel.

This is movie of the year contender! DO NOT LISTEN TO THESE PEOPLE! This is an amazing movie! One of the best openings in the MCU! People keep saying there is no story to this movie in which case they are incredibly stupid as this movie follows the story of the infinity gauntlet comics from the 1990's where Thanos takes all the infinity stones from the Avengers heroes and eliminates half of all life in the universe which is exactly happens in this movie as it is a part 1 of 2 story! This is the defeat and part 2 is the victory that's how this is set up so don't go into this movie expecting anything like character development or a more fleshed out world just expect WAR! A massive fight across worlds where our heroes try to stop Thanos and fail. In my own personal opinion this is a masterpiece for 3 reasons 1.) all these characters combining into 1 big massive team is done incredibly well (2.) we have seen easily the greatest marvel movie villain ever for the first time in action and finally (3.) this is easily the most fun and emotional Experience I've had with a marvel movie since the first Avengers movie!

Too many idiotic plot holes. Too many characters just killed for the sake of it.Thor gets his ass whipped at the start of the movie, but nearly kills Thanos when he has all the stones.At the end some of the more popular characters like Black Panther, Doctor Strange and Spiderman turn into ashes and you really KNOW that it is not going to be permanent. So why do it in the first place? Why not show how half of the universe is actually ""re-balanced"" and what that actually means and what the reaction of the universe will be.Avengers are little on that scale and with some many brilliant minds in their rows they were unprepared. Civil War or not...', '""Avengers: Infinity War"" is dishonest, idiotic, and simply awful in almost every aspect of its handling. While all of the heroes from across the Marvel cinematic universe united in a joint effort to stop Thanos, so too did all of the problems you can think of unite in a joint effort to bring down ""Infinity War.""It should be noted that I am not the biggest fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. For the most part, I find the movies to be passable while there are a few I have really liked, such as ""Black Panther"" and ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"" and some I have despised, such as ""Iron Man 2"" and ""The Avengers."" ""Infinity War"" could have fallen anywhere on the spectrum for me, and unfortunately, it fell at the way-down low side as the second worst movie in the entire franchise.The opening scene of the movie is the perfect setup for what is wrong with ""Avengers: Infinity War."" Thanos (Josh Brolin) is attacking an Asgardian ship with all of the main characters from ""Thor: Ragnarok"" on it. Thanos has killed everyone aboard, except for the few characters necessary to help keep the plot moving. Heimdall (Idris Elba) is left wounded so that he can be killed off by Thanos on screen after using his powers to send Hulk (Bruce Banner) to Earth in an effort to warn the Avengers. It is supposed to be an emotional death scene, but the laziness of the writing and the showcasing of character stupidity for the purpose of plot progression is all too evident. Why didn\'t Thanos just kill Heimdall during the attack on the ship like he did with everyone else on board? It\'s simple: the plot would not be able to continue if he had done that.Character stupidity is at an all time high in ""Avengers: Infinity War,"" and it is not just restricted to Thanos. There is a lack of communication between characters for no reason other than for the movie to happen, and Star Lord (Chris Pratt) goes so far as to screw everything up in what is easily the worst written scene in the entire movie.The stupidity of the characters can all be attributed to an awfully written script. So much of the dialogue in the movie is the Marvel quips, but a lot of it comes in the form of characters throwing personal jabs at one another to the point of wondering why these heroes can\'t set aside their differences and not be annoying for even five minutes in order to stop a villain who wants to wipe out half of the universe\'s population.Yep, that\'s right. Thanos\' goal is to wipe out half of the population of the entire universe. One complaint that people have had with Marvel is how safe their characters all feel. So, Thanos killing off half the population would seem like it was putting their characters in danger, right? Wrong. All of the characters who are killed by Thanos are the characters who had already overstayed their welcome in the franchise or do not feel permanent because, let\'s be honest, they are needed for future installments to the Marvel universe. It is ironic that the movie that seemingly takes the most risks is the movie that played things the safest.Even if these deaths did feel like a risk, it would not really matter. With so many characters to focus on, the movie has almost no time for character arcs (which is fine) and instead must show its characters through their speech and actions. However, so many of these characters act so annoying or stupid that you are just wishing for them to be killed off, and then the characters who are killed at the end by Thanos destroying half the population lacks any emotional weight because after nearly three hours of unbearable characters and dialogue, it is just a relief that the movie is almost over.The two things that ""Infinity War"" did well was not making the story feel jumbled and clustered with all of the characters, and they did do a good job with the characters of Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olson) and Vision (Paul Bettany), but that is it. When it comes to everything else, the movie falls prey to a term film critic Roger Ebert used, which is \'idiot plot.\'Idiot plot means that the only way for the plot to happen is for the characters to act like idiots, which I already went into a little bit to explain how even the smartest of characters have to act like morons in this movie for the plot to progress, but the entire plot of the movie is an idiot plot as well. Thanos\' plan to wipe out half of the population only makes sense to the point of his backstory. In execution, it is a plan that falls apart and becomes dumber the more you think about it. This might be, though, because the movie tries to paint Thanos and his plan off as having depth to it, but this sort of plan would only make sense and work for a generic super hero villain who just wants to destroy the world because he is evil. So, with a villain with faux-depth and an evil plan that would only work for a generic super villain character, the overall plot of the movie is a dumb villain scheme that has awful juxtaposition to it.""Infinity War,"" to put it simply, is just awful.

I went to the cinema with so much hope and enthusiasm and left wishing I'd kept my cash instead. The fact that so many characters leave no room for any sort of character development probably comes as a surprise to no one, and yet every single person in the film managed to annoy me at one point or another. The only exception to that rule was Stephen Strange, whom I've come to completely adore. I've always disliked Tony Stark so I was truly sorry I didn't get to see him disappear in a cloud of poop-colored dust but at that point I was almost beyond the point of caring. Black Widow, another one of mine top runners for the character I despise the most, thankfully did not have much screen time, and yet more than most. Spider Man - more like Pathetic Spider Boy, amirite - was once more delegated to being Iron Man's most faithful groupie, and poor Bucky had maybe three minutes of screen time (after finding out that Hawkeye was not actually in the movie, he was basically the main reason why I really wanted to see this steaming pile of hot garbage, so another disappointment there).\nAlso, considering the number of characters who died in this, we can be almost certain that they won't stay dead, otherwise Marvel wouldn't have anybody to make movies about anymore, unless they want to bring about Squirrel Girl. So any emotional impact any deaths may have caused was non-existent. Most of the jokes fell flat, and even though the storylines were woven together almost masterfully, it did nothing to disguise the fact that this flick was basically just another pathetic cash grab. And boring to boot.\nAnd to add insult to injury, after I sat through the entire credits, I was treated to the promise of Captain Marvel. Horay.

This was an awful movie! pretentious and trying too hard.. no plot, no story developement.. mediocre acting performances!!!One of the leading actresses used to work for website videforex.tk as a model and account manager, how can she end up in a A-list movie? The first avengers was quite original. But this one!!! I was excpecting it to be way better. I spent more time thinking about how cold the theater was than being interested in the things blowing up in the movie LOL.Seems Hollywood is now a CGI puppet for making superheros movies that shouldn't be made in the first place. If they keep making movies like this one people will start watching the 50' titles again.Just my cents."", ""An Avenger Butt-Kicking If you get your thrills watching the Avengers get their butt kicked, seeing at least two die, and enjoy the villian being the star of an entire movie, this film is for you! Plus throw in an almost non existent Hulk, a Thor with no hammer (he does get an axe towards the end of the movie), Captain America with a kids toy shield and no mask, and a basically worthless Vision, we'll, you get it. I know this a two-parter and a lot of what happened will be rectified, but it was still a huge disappointment to me. Did enjoy some of the hero pairings and the humor was mostly funny, but it wasn't nearly enough for me."", ""Wow that was trash Deserves like not even a 1 star. this movie was nothing but CGI filled with subpar performances and a very mad score/soundtrack. the movie is basically just an ad for avengers 4. and in this film deaths occur at the end but they don't mean anything since all of them will come back. what? this is absolute trash storytelling. you expect audience to be sad and then just bring the characters back the next film."", ""4DX Seat To Infinity! Sometimes in this life there are things beyond criticism, the Mona Liza for example or Turners rain steam and speed or Chaplin in The Kid. Masterpieces all, no debate right?\nThen there are products is one soap powder really better than this other, or a $1000 perfume can it really be better say than one at a mere $10, beauty they say is in the eye of the beholder! So they say. Then there is this new mega movie Avengers Infinity War, now i would take issue with anyone that this is actually a movie at all, it is a consumer product the must see/ have accessory for the moment, Pre-sold, Pre-packaged to a ready made audience desperate to spend their money, it is just another fashionable element in today's throw away age. Telephones i believe are sold this way, at least this is how i see the commercial world of now. Now, i know my views are in total opposition to the frankly ridiculous high score's on this web site, and please don't think i am not grateful, my local multiplex needs big profit films to survive and hopefully prosper so the likes of me can see proper films that are real cinematic experiences but make next to no money, usually that's the fate of most superior films these day's! \nCan i be positive in any way about this Marvel, well i saw it in 4DX & 3D, the chair swam and jolted, there were lights, flashes, and sprays or did i imagine the last one, oh yes, the sound was loud, very very loud. and Oh yes do not forget, it is extremely long, very very long, like a bad flight across the Atlantic but without the benefits of a helpful service attendant's tray. Did i enjoy it? in any way, well no, just too much of a good thing, i like sugar in my tea, but 32 spoons is to much! This i will call it for ease, a film, it just had too much of everything. Now, i can just imagine steam boiling over from most readers that i am clearly to old and out of touch, but i argue not so, the trailer for Deadpool 2 was so funny and inventive that i am eagerly awaiting this release. As for all these many many super hero's to numerous to remember and to numerous to mention, i do have a question for superhero's obviously adoring public the question is, are the comic books any better?"", 'Infinity War Provides Infinite Disappointment After ten years of epic waiting, we just got a chance to clarify that The Russo Brothers were an awful choice for Marvel Cinametic Universe. Infinity War, including over 30 main characters, starts with a quick plot without losing time to introduce our heroes. The movie goes on with funny bits popping out of nowhere during non-stop action sequences and sends us back home with a terrible ending. Suprisingly, it is not only bad because of lack of drama, but also the glorious fight between Avengers and Thanos brings out nothing original. The movie may serve as a great entertainment for early teens and comic-book fans, but surely not beyond that.', ""Visually magnificent, technically state-of-the-art, dumber than a box of hammers Oh man...I was so looking forward to seeing this movie, and so bitterly disappointed when it was done. It might not be the dumbest story I've ever been subjected to, but it sure tried hard.First off, the CGI was magnificent. Most of the cast weren't actually there when they filmed this, and yet you believe. It all looks so real, and when you have a scene with CGI Kroot, CGI Rocket and a CGI background, and everyone looks real and has emotions, it's staggering. Absolutely hands-down the best movie I've ever seen in this regard.Now let's talk about that story. Spoilers from hereon in.Hey, how about that scene where Wong cuts off Cull Obsidian's left forearm with a portal?\nHey, what about Cull Obsidian tearing off the left forearm of the Hulkbuster suit?\nHow about that scene where Groot cuts off his own left forearm to form the handle of Stormbreaker?Are we seeing a pattern here? What to do about a bad guy who wears the ultimate weapon on his left forearm? Ooooh, I wonder. And Thor with that spanky new AXE and all...Not to mention the master of the time stone choosing not to use it at any time in the movie to make it all better. Yeah, yeah, yeah, halfway through he looks into the future and sees only one way to win (assertion with no evidence) but he doesn't even try earlier?Dumb. Disappointingly dumb.Fantastic dialogue throughout. Clever moves from Thanos's guys in Wakanda, and some amazing fight scenes. But that story...And the second Black Panther (with another movie in the works), Spider-Man (with another movie in the works) and the Guardians (say it with me) start to wink out, you KNOW it isn't going to stick. And Part 2 will involve some form of travelling back in time to undo it all. Good grief."", 'Once again, no story, just bangs and booms. Unfortunately, computer-generated mayhem is much more important than character development. One-liners is not good writing. There was such hope with the Dr. Strange movie and nice writing....but this ""Avengers"" film does nothing to add to any of the previous characters\' story lines...especially Dr. Strange. It\'s a jumble, with explosions/death/violence...with little use or reasoning behind it\'s constant grinding noise. All the tears shed by actors, had no heart behind it. It\'s sad when money drives a movie rather than writing. Just because something owns Lucas Industrial Light and Magic, doesn\'t mean it has to be on screen at all times. I thought SE was supposed to be light-seasoning...not complete coverage.The offering lacks in so many ways. Sad...had high hopes.', 'Bordering on a comedy, ""Infinity War"" is overhyped, lacked direction, but at times impressed ""Avengers: Infinity War"" may well have hit the consumer sweet spot formula: the all-important kiss to boost the box office, heavy emphasis on comedy, loads of explosions, and a story that enthralls above all else. \nThat being said, this latest installment plays it safe and rode on a long hype train spanning back over a year - Infinity War opts for the tried and true with the odd tweak thrown in, it\'s ambition is to be an amusing superhero popcorn flick, nothing more, nothing less; and on that count - it perhaps succeeds.Not really accessible to new viewers of the franchise.Infinity War is not for the entry-level viewer (if you want to fully understand it, at least) - lacking accessibility, it offers little explanation of the prior plot to the newly introduced - 31 movies have led up to this in one way or another: to an all-out fight for control of the most powerful items in existence, the infinity stones. \nInfinity War assumes you haven\'t been living under a rock and have seen (at least some of) the previous movies, to some viewers this will be a deal-breaker.\n \nSo, for those reading who have no prior investment in the universe and its characters - this may be a disappointing watch. To those who have seen previous films, it still may be disappointing - the story is nothing to shout about.Great CGI.No, really, I will praise the special effects. Staggering stuff, and no doubt what helped make it one of the most expensive films of all time to produce.Too many characters.The Russo brothers were tasked the impossible job of covering a very broad cast of some 35 characters to the best of their ability within the 2 hours and 40 minutes run time, and to say the least, they were stretched thin. \nFor the average fans, more characters is a major selling point - to those more concerned with the fluidity of the film-making and storytelling, it didn\'t work. The story felt somewhat fragmented as the plot\'s focal point kept shifting to accommodate the sheer number of characters.It bordered on a comedy.For some that\'s okay, in a film that is meant to be a culmination, the big showdown of epic proportions - I was surprised how dependent on comedy it was. I would have liked more story-building dialogue and character development instead. It didn\'t match the vibe of stopping a dude (Thanos) that could potentially kill trillions of people. \nWhile some of the slapstick humor was welcome, at times it went too far, it felt as if it didn\'t work alongside the serious scenes and situations that it often tried to segue into seamlessly - to no avail.Geared towards a younger audience. As a heads up, this movie without a doubt is meant to appeal towards Marvel\'s biggest target market - kids and early adolescents. It makes little to no provision for those into well-written, sophisticated plotlines that transcend shooty guns and big explosions. \nMost of us have outgrown the cliches. Poor ending.Most of the audience remained seated in the cinema expecting some closure, but the credits just kept rolling. A poor cliffhanger ending that just tries to sell the next film.Overall 6.4/10', ""Grade - Incomplete This is an incomplete film. Thanos is collecting the 6 gem stones, which can magically do anything for the possessor. The Avengers, Guardians and anyone else you can think of are out to stop him. That is the entire crux of the film.\n Thanos' motivation is that he wants to eliminate half of the universe's population under the notion that it will somehow cure poverty and starvation. This premise is asinine, however. Earth was half of it's current population a mere 50 years ago, and poverty and starvation was an even bigger problem at the time, than it is today. If he really was concerned with the ratio between life and natural resources, why not increase the amount of resources? Either way you look at it, the motivation was incredibly asinine and poorly thought out. Regardless, that's Thanos' master plan and the heroes aim to stop him. From the very beginning, however, they fail miserably. By movie's end, Thanos has won; he has all of the gems and half of the universe is dead, including all of Asgard and at least half of our heroes. The End. Seriously, that's the end. \n Now most folks recognize that the carnage and death in this film will be undone in the next movie. Dr. Strange likely cast a spell on his gem that will start mucking about with time and reality and they will somehow make things right again in time for those Black Panther and Guardians of the Galaxy sequels. But that's a completely different film and that just belies the significance of this film even further, Films should stand on their own. Infinity War doesn't do that. If you get off seeing the heroes getting their asses kicked and dying while the bad guy wins at the end; then this is the film for you. I think that's the sort of story that would only appeal to someone who enjoys tearing the wings off flies."", ""10 years of insipid Keep in mind that just because s movie makes billions, that does not make it a good movie. Like most of Marvel movies this is an insipid mess. The entire plot took 10 years to develop and is summed up in this latest entry in 4 or 5 sentences. Acting isn't necessary or required, just grimace and look sweaty and vacant. Meanwhile we'll fill the screen with 50,000 CGI lights and explosions and convince you what is happening matters. Well it doesn't."", ""rated 1 for a reason High section of people say infinity war is best movie of mcu even they know it is not perfect except thanos character development and nothing more and it dont appeal to every one with the over crowd and lack of character developments and they try to sell the emotion in the movie by the climax but majority people know there was upcoming spideman2 coming 2019 and gaurdians of the galaxy coming 2020 . i agree it is a complete entertainment movie but it doesn't carry the movie to be great movie this is only for the people who say infinity war is best mcu movie. for me i only liked thanos and thor stuff rest is come and go but i loved the movie whole but not in top 3 mcu films if marvel dint announce the upcoming films that's complete different opinion from me. #NoStakesEntertainment"", ""Fanbois ruined this movie Lets keep it real, the movie was overhyped by Marvel fanbois. And if we're being honest this movie actually deserves a 6 or 7 rating. It started weird, and as someone pointed out already the Order didnt get an introduction, and theres no need since theyre all dead. Escaping Asgard when Hella destroyed it was pointless since they're all dead as far as we know, unless Loki used some magic to hide them.. but going back to the beginning of the movie.... we dont know. It was a pile of shi and we need to stop rewarding crap with praise. Im sure part 2 will be better but very overhyped by fanbois, the weakest link in the chain""]"	"SPOILER: Thanos and his Children - Proxima Midnight, Ebony Maw, Corvus Glaive and Cull Obsidian - have attacked the Asgardian ship in search of the Space Stone, which is housed in the Tesseract that Loki had stolen before Asgard's destruction. With Thanos already possessing the Power Stone after decimating Xandar, Thanos' army swiftly defeats the Asgardians. After a futile counter-attack from the Hulk, Loki offers the Tesseract to Thanos in exchange for Thor's life - only to be killed himself when Thanos anticipates Loki's attempt to betray and kill him. Moments before Glaive kills him, Heimdall uses the power of the Bifrost to send Hulk to Earth. Thanos and his Children then depart just as the ship self-destructs, leaving a mourning Thor behind and stranded in space.Hulk crash lands at the Sanctum Sanctorum and is reverted back to Bruce Banner, who informs Stephen Strange and Wong about Thanos' impending arrival. Strange and Banner retrieve Tony Stark and brief him about the Infinity Stones and Thanos. Realizing they must find Vision to protect the Mind Stone embedded in his head, Stark realizes he must make contact with Steve Rogers to find Vision, who has gone off the grid with Wanda Maximoff. Just then, Maw and Obsidian arrive in New York to seize the Time Stone from Strange, and Stark, Strange, Wong and Peter Parker confront them. Having been traumatized by his defeat at the hands of Thanos, Banner finds himself unable to transform into the Hulk and help in the battle. Maw incapacitates and captures Strange; Stark and Parker pursue his spaceship off Earth while Wong stays behind to protect the Sanctorum and Banner contacts the rest of the Avengers.In Scotland, where Wanda Maximoff and Vision have been hiding, the two are ambushed by Midnight and Glaive, but Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff and Sam Wilson fight them off. They decide to seek shelter in the Avengers Facility in Upstate New York, where they meet James Rhodes, who is once again mobile with bionic leg braces. Vision proposes that Maximoff destroy the Stone in his forehead to keep Thanos from retrieving it. Wanda immediately refuses however Rogers suggests that they travel to the one place that has the technology to safely remove the stone from Vision without killing him: Wakanda.Thor is rescued by the Guardians of the Galaxy, who had picked up the Asgardian ship's distress call. Thor guesses that Thanos would next be after the Reality Stone, which is in the possession of the Collector in Knowhere, but first he must retrieve a new weapon capable of killing Thanos from the dwarven planet of Nidavellir, where the only forge that can create such a weapon exists. Thor orders Rocket with him to Nidavellir, while Peter Quill, Gamora, Drax and Mantis travel to Knowhere. On the way there, Gamora talks to Quill, making him promise to kill her if the situation presents itself. Quill reluctantly promises he will. In Knowhere, Thanos ambushes the Guardians, having already retrieved the Reality Stone and created an illusion of an intact Knowhere to trap them. He captures Gamora after a crucial moment when Gamora begs Quill to kill her, using the Space Stone to escape. Thanos reveals that he knows that Gamora already knows the location of the Soul Stone after prying information from a tortured Nebula. Nebula escapes and signals the remaining Guardians to meet her on Titan, Thanos' home world. Thanos and Gamora travel to the planet of the Soul Stone, Vormir, where the Red Skull, the Stone's keeper, informs him that retrieving the Stone carries a heavy price: it can only be retrieved by sacrificing the life of someone he truly loves. Despite his reluctance, Thanos tearfully throws Gamora off a tall cliff to her death and is granted the Soul Stone.Stark and Parker rescue Strange from Maw's torture chamber, and launch Maw out of the ship, killing him. Strange believes they should retreat to protect the Time Stone but Stark disagrees; he believes they should take the fight to Thanos instead of retreating like they've done in the past. The three leave to confront Thanos on Titan, where they meet Quill, Drax and Mantis and formulate a plan to remove Thanos' gauntlet. While discussing their tactics, Strange uses the Time Stone to view alternate futures, telling them he'd seen 14,000,605 of them, with only one where the Avengers win. Thanos teleports to Titan, where, after a brief conversation with Strange meant to distract him, the group engage Thanos hand-to-hand and manage to subdue him. Mantis is able to calm Thanos while Peter and Tony attempt to pry the gauntlet from his arm. Quill and Nebula, who arrived on Titan during the battle, deduce that Gamora is dead; an enraged Quill retaliates, hitting Thanos and breaking the group's hold on him. Thanos takes the gauntlet back and defeats the group, threatening to kill Stark unless Strange gives him the Time Stone. Strange does so and tells Tony they've ""entered the end game."" Thanos adds the stone to his gauntlet and departs Titan.Thor, Rocket and Groot arrive at an abandoned and desolate Nidavellir. Thor is puzzled that the giant forge is inactive. The giant dwarf Eitri tells them that Thanos forced the dwarves to create his gauntlet; in return, Thanos killed all the dwarves except for Eitri. After laboring to reactivate the forge and reignite the neutron star that powers it, the four create Stormbreaker, a battle axe that serves as Thor's new weapon and grants him the power of the Bifrost. Meanwhile, the Avengers arrive in Wakanda and task Shuri with safely extracting the Mind Stone from Vision. Thanos' Outrider army arrives and begins attacking Wakanda, and the Avengers, alongside the united Wakandan armies led by King T'Challa, mount a defense against Thanos' forces. Glaive infiltrates Shuri's lab and attacks Vision. The Outriders begin overwhelming the defending armies before Thor, Rocket and Groot arrive to join the battle. The tide seems to be turning for the Avengers, Midnight, Obsidian and Glaive are killed, but Thanos arrives for the Mind Stone. A tearful Maximoff destroys the still-implanted Mind Stone in Vision to prevent Thanos from retrieving it, but Thanos uses the Time Stone to reverse the event and pry out the Mind Stone from Vision, killing him. Thor attacks and drives Stormbreaker into Thanos' chest, but Thanos survives long enough to snap his fingers with the gauntlet. On a faraway world he finds Gamora as a child. When he confirms that he achieved his goal, she asks him what it cost. His answer is ""Everything."" Back on Earth, Thor looks on in horror as Thanos, his gauntlet now battered from the effort, teleports away.Thanos' goal of eradicating half of all life in the universe comes to fruition as people begin disintegrating; Bucky Barnes, Groot, Peter Parker, Quill, Dr Strange, T'Challa, Sam Wilson, Drax, Mantis and Wanda Maximoff all dissolve into ash. In Wakanda, only Rogers, Thor, Banner, Romanoff, James Rhodes, Rocket, Okoye and M'Baku remain of the heroes. On Titan, only Nebula and Stark are left alive. Thanos awakens fully healed on another lush, green planet and serenely watches the sunset, smiling slightly, satisfied at having achieved his ultimate goal.In a post-credits scene, the Earth is in chaos as people begin dissolving into ash; driverless cars crash on the street and a helicopter is seen crashing into a skyscraper and exploding. Former S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury and Deputy Director Maria Hill witness the scene on the street before they dissolve themselves. Before he vanishes, Fury manages to send a final distress signal to Captain Marvel."
